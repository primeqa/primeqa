       "{'document_plaintext': \"Over the Rainbow - wikipedia Over the Rainbow This article is about the 1939 song . For other uses , see Over the Rainbow ( disambiguation ) . `` Over the Rainbow '' Song by Judy Garland Published 1939 Genre Ballad Composer ( s ) Harold Arlen Lyricist ( s ) E.Y. Harburg `` Over the Rainbow '' is a ballad , with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by Yip Harburg . It was written for the movie The Wizard of Oz and was sung by actress Judy Garland , in her starring role as Dorothy Gale . It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became Garland 's signature song , as well as one of the most enduring standards of the 20th century . About five minutes into the film , Dorothy sings the song after failing to get Aunt Em , Uncle Henry , and the farmhands to listen to her relate an unpleasant incident involving her dog , Toto , and the town spinster , Miss Gulch ( Margaret Hamilton ) . Aunt Em tells her to `` find yourself a place where you wo n't get into any trouble '' . This prompts her to walk off by herself , musing to Toto , `` Some place where there is n't any trouble . Do you suppose there is such a place , Toto ? There must be . It 's not a place you can get to by a boat , or a train . It 's far , far away . Behind the moon , beyond the rain ... '' , at which point she begins singing .

The American Film Institute also ranked the song the greatest movie song of all time on the list of `` AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs '' . The very first artist to record the song was actually big band singer Bea Wain , who at the time was a featured vocalist with the Larry Clinton Orchestra . MGM prohibited release of this version until The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) had opened and audiences heard Judy Garland perform it . It was adopted ( along with Irving Berlin 's 1942 hit `` White Christmas '' ) by American troops in Europe in World War II , as a symbol of the United States . In April 2005 , the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp recognizing lyricist Yip Harburg 's accomplishments ; it features the opening lyric from the song . The song was used as an audio wakeup call in the STS - 88 space shuttle mission in Flight Day 4 , which was dedicated to astronaut Robert D. Cabana from his daughter , Sara . The song was honored with the 2014 Towering Song Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame and was sung at its dinner on June 12 , 2014 , by Jackie Evancho . In April 2016 , The Daily Telegraph listed the song as number 8 on its list of the 100 greatest songs of all time . In March 2017 , Garland 's original rendition of the song was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or artistically significant '' . The Wizard of Oz ( edit ) The song 's sequence and the entirety of the Kansas scenes were directed by King Vidor , though he was not credited . The song was initially deleted from the film after a preview in San Luis Obispo , because MGM chief executive Louis B. Mayer and producer Mervyn LeRoy thought it `` slowed down the picture '' and that `` the song sounds like something for Jeanette MacDonald , not for a little girl singing in a barnyard '' . However , the persistence of associate producer Arthur Freed and Garland 's vocal coach / mentor Roger Edens to keep it in the film eventually paid off -- it is for this sequence that the film is best known and remembered . At the start of the film , part of the song is played by the MGM orchestra over the opening credits . A reprise of it was deleted after being filmed . An additional chorus was to be sung by Dorothy while she was locked in the Witch 's castle , helplessly awaiting death as the hourglass ran out . However , although the visual portion of that reprise is presumably lost , the soundtrack of it survives and was included in the 2 - CD Deluxe Edition of the film 's soundtrack , released by Rhino Entertainment in 1995 . In that extremely intense and fear - filled rendition , Dorothy cries her way through it , unable to finish , concluding with a tear - filled , `` I 'm frightened , Auntie Em , I 'm frightened ! '' This phrase was retained in the film and is followed immediately by Aunt Em 's brief appearance in the crystal ball , where she is soon replaced by the visage of the witch ( Hamilton ) , mocking and taunting Dorothy before turning toward the camera to cackle . Another instrumental version is played in the underscore in the final scene , and over the closing credits . Original Garland recordings ( edit ) `` Over the Rainbow '' from The Wizard of Oz A sample of the original version of `` Over the Rainbow '' from The Wizard of Oz , sung by Judy Garland . Problems playing this file ? See media help . On October 7 , 1938 , Judy Garland first recorded the song on the MGM soundstages , using an arrangement by Murray Cutter . In September 1939 , a studio recording of the song , not from the actual film soundtrack , was recorded and released as a single by Decca Records . In March 1940 , that same recording was included on a Decca 78 - RPM four - record studio cast album entitled The Wizard of Oz . Although this is not the version of the song featured in the film , Decca would continue to re-release the so - called `` Cast Album '' well into the 1960s after it was re-issued as a single - record 33 \\u200b ⁄ RPM LP . It was not until 1956 , when MGM released the true soundtrack album from the film , that the film version of the song was made available to the public . The 1956 soundtrack release was timed to coincide with the television premiere of the film . The soundtrack version has been re-released several times over the years , including in a `` Deluxe Edition '' from Rhino Records in 1995 . ' Over the Rainbow ' has become part of my life . It 's so symbolic of everybody 's dreams and wishes that I 'm sure that 's why some people get tears in their eyes when they hear it . I 've sung it thousands of times and it 's still the song that 's closest to my heart . -- Judy Garland , in a letter to Harold Arlen Following the film 's release in 1939 , the song became Garland 's signature song and she would perform it for the next 30 years , until her death in 1969 . She performed it without altering it , singing exactly as she did for the film . She explained her fidelity by saying that she was staying true to the character of Dorothy and to the message of really being somewhere over the rainbow . In 2017 , Garland 's recorded rendition of the film was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or artistically significant '' . Lyrics ( edit ) An introductory verse ( `` When all the world is a hopeless jumble ... '' ) that was not used in the film is often used in theatrical productions of The Wizard of Oz and is included in the piano sheet music book of songs from the film . It was also used in renditions by Frank Sinatra , by Al Bowlly , by Doris Day on her album Hooray For Hollywood ( 1958 ) ( Vol. 1 ) , by Tony Bennett on his albums Tony Bennett Sings a String of Harold Arlen ( 1961 ) and Here 's to the Ladies ( 1995 ) , by Ella Fitzgerald , by Sarah Vaughan , and by Norma Waterson , among others . Garland herself sang the introductory verse only once , on a 1948 radio broadcast of The Louella Parsons Show . Lyrics for a second verse ( `` Once by a word only lightly spoken ... '' ) appear in the British edition of the sheet music . International artists ( edit ) The first German version in the English language was recorded by the Swing Orchestra Heinz Wehner ( 1908 -- 1945 ) in March 1940 in Berlin . Wehner , at this time an international well - known German Swing Artist , also took over the vocals .

Criminal Justice is the system of practices and institutions of governments directed at upholding social control , deterring and mitigating crime , or sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties and rehabilitation efforts . Criminal justice is also a field of study . Those accused of crime have some protections against abuse of investigatory and prosecution powers . Criminal justice systems are very different around the world depending on the country . In the United States when a person or individual is charged of a crime they are given rights . In some countries when someone is charged with a crime there is no trial and they are immediately sentenced with no rights . In the United States the criminal justice system was taken from the British criminal justice system . Today a lot of modern countries also have adopted the British criminal justice system . In less developed countries and war - torn countries no justice system is in use . These countries often use military powers to enforce their laws , this is often the result of the killing of the individual that supposedly committed this crime with no trial given . In the United States , criminal justice policy has been guided by the 1967 President 's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice , which issued a ground - breaking report `` The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society '' . This report made more than 200 recommendations as part of a comprehensive approach toward the prevention and fighting of crime . Some of those recommendations found their way into the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 . The Commission advocated a `` systems '' approach to criminal justice , with improved coordination among law enforcement , courts , and correctional agencies . The President 's Commission defined the criminal justice system as the means for society to `` enforce the standards of conduct necessary to protect individuals and the community . '' The United States justice system differs from other countries ' systems such as its rank among other systems in the world . The United States justice system ranks 19th according to the Rule of Law index that was assessed in 2014 . The United States leads however in the number of incarcerated citizens in the world ; there are 2.4 million people who are currently incarcerated . The top five countries according to the Rule of Law index are Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland and the Netherlands . All four of these countries practice criminal justice differently , for example Finland does not use the trial by jury system such as in the United States . Finland has found that system to be flawed and sometimes biased to the individual on trial . The criminal justice system in England and Wales aims to `` reduce crime by bringing more offences to justice , and to raise public confidence that the system is fair and will deliver for the law - abiding citizen . '' In Canada , the criminal justice system aims to balance the goals of crime control and prevention , and justice ( equity , fairness , protection of individual rights ) . In Sweden , the overarching goal for the criminal justice system is to reduce crime and increase the security of the people . In China , the justice system aims to keep the society functioning well and to protect every person 's rights . Overall , criminal justice plays a huge role throughout society as a whole in all of its locations .

Online Etymology Dictionary . ) ; legal comes from Latin legalis , from lex `` law , '' `` statute '' ( Harper , Douglas . `` legal '' . Online Etymology Dictionary. ) is a system of rules usually enforced through a set of institutions . The purpose of law is to provide an objective set of rules for governing conduct and maintaining order in a society . The oldest known codified law is the Code of Hammurabi , dating back to about 1754 BC . The preface directly credits the laws to the code of hammurabi of Ur . In different parts of the world , law could be established by philosophers or religion . In the modern world , laws are typically created and enforced by governments . These codified laws may coexist with or contradict other forms of social control , such as religious proscriptions , professional rules and ethics , or the cultural mores and customs of a society . Within the realm of codified law , there are generally two forms of law that the courts are concerned with . Civil laws are rules and regulations which govern transactions and grievances between individual citizens . Criminal law is concerned with actions which are dangerous or harmful to society as a whole , in which prosecution is pursued not by an individual but rather by the state . The purpose of criminal law is to provide the specific definition of what constitutes a crime and to prescribe punishments for committing such a crime . No criminal law can be valid unless it includes both of these factors . The subject of criminal justice is , of course , primarily concerned with the enforcement of criminal law . Criminal justice system ( edit ) Definition ( edit ) The criminal justice system consists of three main parts : ( 1 ) Law Enforcement ( police officers , FBI , Department of Homeland Security , etc ... ) ; ( 2 ) Courts ( attorneys , judges , etc ... ) ; and ( 3 ) corrections ( jails , prisons , probation and parole ) . In the criminal justice system , these distinct agencies operate together both under the rule of law and as the principal means of maintaining the rule of law within society . This image shows the procedure in the criminal justice system For the purposes of section 8 ( 6 ) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 and section 194A ( 6 ) of the Criminal Procedure ( Scotland ) Act 1995 , the criminal justice system includes , in particular , the investigation of offences and the treatment of offenders . Branches of the criminal justice system ( edit ) There are three branches of the Criminal Justice system . 1 . ) The first being police / Law enforcement , the law enforcement branch enforces the laws in their state , county , or assigned jurisdiction . The main purpose for law enforcement officers is to uphold their country 's , state 's , or local laws . The Definition of Law Enforcement : Law enforcement describes the individuals and agencies responsible for enforcing laws and maintaining public order and public safety . Law enforcement includes the prevention , detection , and investigation of crime , and the apprehension and detention of individuals suspected of law violation . 2 . ) Courts uphold the law in ways to prevent them from being broken in the future . When an individual is charged by law enforcement it is the courts job to determine if the charges are justified and if so what punishments are required to make sure or help prevent the individual or individuals from proceeding to commit the crime or crimes again in the future . The definition of a court : Government entity authorized to resolve legal disputes . Judges sometimes use `` court '' to refer to themselves in the third person , as in `` the court has read the briefs . '' 3 . ) The third branch of the criminal justice system is corrections , the correctional branch duties are to make sure that the punishment or in some cases rehabilitation is seen through until the end of the determined sentence provided by the judge ( Courts ) . Definition of corrections : Institutional corrections refers to those persons housed in secure correctional facilities . There are many different types of correctional facilities , operated by different government entities . Local jails are operated by county or municipal authorities , and typically hold offenders for short periods ranging from a single day to a year . Law enforcement ( edit ) Main article : Law enforcement The first contact a defendant has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police ( or law enforcement ) who investigate the suspected wrongdoing and make an arrest , but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation , a national level law enforcement agency is called in . When warranted , law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order . The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility . The word comes from the Latin politia ( `` civil administration '' ) , which itself derives from the Ancient Greek πόλις , for polis ( `` city '' ) . The first police force comparable to the present - day police was established in 1667 under King Louis XIV in France , although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the Marine Police in London , the Glasgow Police , and the Napoleonic police of Paris . Police are primarily concerned with keeping the peace and enforcing criminal law based on their particular mission and jurisdiction . Formed in 1908 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation began as an entity which could investigate and enforce specific federal laws as an investigative and `` law enforcement agency '' in the United States ; this , however , has constituted only a small portion of overall policing activity . Policing has included an array of activities in different contexts , but the predominant ones are concerned with order maintenance and the provision of services . During modern times , such endeavors contribute toward fulfilling a shared mission among law enforcement organizations with respect to the traditional policing mission of deterring crime and maintaining societal order . Courts ( edit ) Main article : Court A trial at the Old Bailey in London , c. 1808 The courts serve as the venue where disputes are then settled and justice is administered . With regard to criminal justice , there are a number of critical people in any court setting . These critical people are referred to as the courtroom work group and include both professional and non professional individuals . These include the judge , prosecutor , and the defense attorney . The judge , or magistrate , is a person , elected or appointed , who is knowledgeable in the law , and whose function is to objectively administer the legal proceedings and offer a final decision to dispose of a case . In the U.S. and in a growing number of nations , guilt or innocence ( although in the U.S. a jury can never find a defendant `` innocent '' but rather `` not guilty '' ) is decided through the adversarial system . In this system , two parties will both offer their version of events and argue their case before the court ( sometimes before a judge or panel of judges , sometimes before a jury ) . The case should be decided in favor of the party who offers the most sound and compelling arguments based on the law as applied to the facts of the case . The prosecutor , or district attorney , is a lawyer who brings charges against a person , persons or corporate entity . It is the prosecutor 's duty to explain to the court what crime was committed and to detail what evidence has been found which incriminates the accused . The prosecutor should not be confused with a plaintiff or plaintiff 's counsel . Although both serve the function of bringing a complaint before the court , the prosecutor is a servant of the state who makes accusations on behalf of the state in criminal proceedings , while the plaintiff is the complaining party in civil proceedings . A defense attorney counsels the accused on the legal process , likely outcomes for the accused and suggests strategies . The accused , not the lawyer , has the right to make final decisions regarding a number of fundamental points , including whether to testify , and to accept a plea offer or demand a jury trial in appropriate cases . It is the defense attorney 's duty to represent the interests of the client , raise procedural and evidentiary issues , and hold the prosecution to its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . Defense counsel may challenge evidence presented by the prosecution or present exculpatory evidence and argue on behalf of their client . At trial , the defense attorney may attempt to offer a rebuttal to the prosecutor 's accusations . In the U.S. , an accused person is entitled to a government - paid defense attorney if he or she is in jeopardy of losing his or her life and / or liberty . Those who can not afford a private attorney may be provided one by the state . Historically , however , the right to a defense attorney has not always been universal . For example , in Tudor England criminals accused of treason were not permitted to offer arguments in their defense . In many jurisdictions , there is no right to an appointed attorney , if the accused is not in jeopardy of losing his or her liberty . The final determination of guilt or innocence is typically made by a third party , who is supposed to be disinterested . This function may be performed by a judge , a panel of judges , or a jury panel composed of unbiased citizens . This process varies depending on the laws of the specific jurisdiction . In some places the panel ( be it judges or a jury ) is required to issue a unanimous decision , while in others only a majority vote is required . In America , this process depends on the state , level of court , and even agreements between the prosecuting and defending parties . Some nations do not use juries at all , or rely on theological or military authorities to issue verdicts . Some cases can be disposed of without the need for a trial . In fact , the vast majority are . If the accused confesses his or her guilt , a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly . Some nations , such as America , allow plea bargaining in which the accused pleads guilty , nolo contendere or not guilty , and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment , where the prosecution 's case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people . This reduced sentence is sometimes a reward for sparing the state the expense of a formal trial . Many nations do not permit the use of plea bargaining , believing that it coerces innocent people to plead guilty in an attempt to avoid a harsh punishment . The entire trial process , whatever the country , is fraught with problems and subject to criticism . Bias and discrimination form an ever - present threat to an objective decision . Any prejudice on the part of the lawyers , the judge , or jury members threatens to destroy the court 's credibility . Some people argue that the often Byzantine rules governing courtroom conduct and processes restrict a layman 's ability to participate , essentially reducing the legal process to a battle between the lawyers . In this case , the criticism is that the decision is based less on sound justice and more on the lawyer 's eloquence and charisma . This is a particular problem when the lawyer performs in a substandard manner . The jury process is another area of frequent criticism , as there are few mechanisms to guard against poor judgment or incompetence on the part of the layman jurors . Judges themselves are very subject to bias subject to things as ordinary as the length of time since their last break . Manipulations of the court system by defense and prosecution attorneys , law enforcement as well as the defendants have occurred and there have been cases where justice was denied . Corrections and rehabilitation ( edit ) The Huntsville Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville , Texas is a prison , a component of a corrections system Main article : Corrections Offenders are then turned over to the correctional authorities , from the court system after the accused has been found guilty . Like all other aspects of criminal justice , the administration of punishment has taken many different forms throughout history . Early on , when civilizations lacked the resources necessary to construct and maintain prisons , exile and execution were the primary forms of punishment . Historically shame punishments and exile have also been used as forms of censure . The most publicly visible form of punishment in the modern era is the prison . Prisons may serve as detention centers for prisoners after trial . For containment of the accused , jails are used . Early prisons were used primarily to sequester criminals and little thought was given to living conditions within their walls . In America , the Quaker movement is commonly credited with establishing the idea that prisons should be used to reform criminals . This can also be seen as a critical moment in the debate regarding the purpose of punishment . Qur'anic education for offenders at the Central Jail Faisalabad in Faisalabad , Pakistan Punishment ( in the form of prison time ) may serve a variety of purposes . First , and most obviously , the incarceration of criminals removes them from the general population and inhibits their ability to perpetrate further crimes . A new goal of prison punishments is to offer criminals a chance to be rehabilitated . Many modern prisons offer schooling or job training to prisoners as a chance to learn a vocation and thereby earn a legitimate living when they are returned to society . Religious institutions also have a presence in many prisons , with the goal of teaching ethics and instilling a sense of morality in the prisoners . If a prisoner is released before his time is served , he is released as a parole . This means that they are released , but the restrictions are greater than that of someone on probation . There are numerous other forms of punishment which are commonly used in conjunction with or in place of prison terms . Monetary fines are one of the oldest forms of punishment still used today . These fines may be paid to the state or to the victims as a form of reparation . Probation and house arrest are also sanctions which seek to limit a person 's mobility and his or her opportunities to commit crimes without actually placing them in a prison setting . Furthermore , many jurisdictions may require some form of public or community service as a form of reparations for lesser offenses . In Corrections , the Department ensures court - ordered , pre-sentence chemical dependency assessments , related Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative specific examinations and treatment will occur for offenders sentenced to Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative in compliance with RCW 9.94 A. 660 . Execution or capital punishment is still used around the world . Its use is one of the most heavily debated aspects of the criminal justice system . Some societies are willing to use executions as a form of political control , or for relatively minor misdeeds . Other societies reserve execution for only the most sinister and brutal offenses . Others still have discontinued the practice entirely , believing the use of execution to be excessively cruel or.

It emerged as an academic discipline in the 1920s , beginning with Berkeley police chief August Vollmer who established a criminal justice program at the University of California , Berkeley in 1916 . Vollmer 's work was carried on by his student , O.W. Wilson , who led efforts to professionalize policing and reduce corruption . Other programs were established in the United States at Indiana University , Michigan State University , San Jose State University , and the University of Washington . As of 1950 , criminal justice students were estimated to number less than 1,000 . Until the 1960s , the primary focus of criminal justice in the United States was on policing and police science . Throughout the 1960s and 1970s , crime rates soared and social issues took center stage in the public eye . A number of new laws and studies focused federal resources on researching new approaches to crime control . The Warren Court ( the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren ) , issued a series of rulings which redefined citizen 's rights and substantially altered the powers and responsibilities of police and the courts . The Civil Rights Era offered significant legal and ethical challenges to the status quo . In the late 1960s , with the establishment of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration ( LEAA ) and associated policy changes that resulted with the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 . The LEAA provided grants for criminology research , focusing on social aspects of crime . By the 1970s , there were 729 academic programs in criminology and criminal justice in the United States . Largely thanks to the Law Enforcement Education Program , criminal justice students numbered over 100,000 by 1975 . Over time , scholars of criminal justice began to include criminology , sociology , and psychology , among others , to provide a more comprehensive view of the criminal justice system and the root causes of crime . Criminal justice studies now combine the practical and technical policing skills with a study of social deviance as a whole . Criminal justice degree programs at four - year institutions typically include coursework in statistics , methods of research , criminal justice , policing , U.S court systems , criminal courts , corrections , community corrections , criminal procedure , criminal law , victimology , juvenile justice , and a variety of special topics . A number of universities offer a Bachelor of Criminal Justice . History ( edit ) Main article : History of criminal justice Prisoners at a whipping post in a Delaware prison , c. 1907 The modern criminal justice system has evolved since ancient times , with new forms of punishment , added rights for offenders and victims , and policing reforms . These developments have reflected changing customs , political ideals , and economic conditions . In ancient times through the Middle Ages , exile was a common form of punishment . During the Middle Ages , payment to the victim ( or the victim 's family ) , known as wergild , was another common punishment , including for violent crimes . For those who could not afford to buy their way out of punishment , harsh penalties included various forms of corporal punishment . These included mutilation , branding , and flogging , as well as execution . Though a prison , Le Stinche , existed as early as the 14th century in Florence , Italy , incarceration was not widely used until the 19th century . Correctional reform in the United States was first initiated by William Penn , towards the end of the 17th century . For a time , Pennsylvania 's criminal code was revised to forbid torture and other forms of cruel punishment , with jails and prisons replacing corporal punishment . These reforms were reverted , upon Penn 's death in 1718 . Under pressure from a group of Quakers , these reforms were revived in Pennsylvania toward the end of the 18th century , and led to a marked drop in Pennsylvania 's crime rate . Patrick Colquhoun , Henry Fielding and others led significant reforms during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . The first official criminal justice systems was created by the British during the American revolution , they created the system to primarily justify hangings to the citizens of their government . In each selected area or / and district there was a magistrate that in today 's time would be known as a judge . These individuals were in charge of determining if the Crown or also known as the British government had enough evidence to hang an individual for a crime . The British would not always hang an individual for committing a crime , there would also be trials for punishments that would be carried out by cleaning ships , prison ships , or be locked up on British mainland . During the American revolution the primary type of punishment was to be hanged or sent to prison ships such as the notorious HMS Jersey . After the American revolution the British - based Criminal justice system was then adopted by other developing nations ( Such as the United States ) . Modern police ( edit ) The first modern police force is commonly said to be the Metropolitan Police in London , established in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel . Based on the Peelian principles , it promoted the preventive role of police as a deterrent to urban crime and disorder . In the United States , police departments were first established in Boston in 1838 , and New York City in 1844 . Early on , police were not respected by the community , as corruption was rampant . In the 1920s , led by Berkeley , California police chief , August Vollmer and O.W. Wilson , police began to professionalize , adopt new technologies , and place emphasis on training and professional qualifications of new hires . Despite such reforms , police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders , and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community . Following urban unrest in the 1960s , police placed more emphasis on community relations , enacted reforms such as increased diversity in hiring , and many police agencies adopted community policing strategies . In the 1990s , CompStat was developed by the New York Police Department as an information - based system for tracking and mapping crime patterns and trends , and holding police accountable for dealing with crime problems . CompStat has since been replicated in police departments across the United States and around the world , with problem - oriented policing , intelligence - led policing , and other information - led policing strategies also adopted .

Agriculture is a major industry in the United States , which is a net exporter of food . As of the 2007 census of agriculture , there were 2.2 million farms , covering an area of 922 million acres ( 3,730,000 km ) , an average of 418 acres ( 169 hectares ) per farm . Although agricultural activity occurs in all states , it is particularly concentrated in the Great Plains , a vast expanse of flat , arable land in the center of the United States and in the region around the Great Lakes known as the Corn Belt . The United States was a leader in seed improvement i.e. hybridization and in expanding uses for crops from the work of George Washington Carver to the development of bioplastics and biofuels . The mechanization of farming and intensive farming have been major themes in U.S. history , including John Deere 's steel plow , Cyrus McCormick 's mechanical reaper , Eli Whitney 's cotton gin to the widespread success of the Fordson tractor and the combine harvesters first made from them . Modern agriculture in the U.S. ranges from the common hobby farms , small - scale producers to large commercial farming covering thousands of acres of cropland or rangeland .

European agricultural practices greatly affected the New England landscape . Colonists brought livestock over from Europe which caused many changes to the land . Grazing animals required a lot of land and food and the act of grazing itself destroyed native grasses , which were being replaced by European species . New species of weeds were introduced and began to thrive as they were capable of withstanding the grazing of animals , whereas native species could not . The practices associated with keeping livestock also contributed to the deterioration of the forests and fields . Colonists would cut down the trees and then allow their cattle and livestock to graze freely in the forest and never plant more trees . The animals trampled and tore up the ground so much as to cause long - term destruction and damage . Soil exhaustion was a huge problem in New England agriculture . Farming with oxen did allow the colonist to farm more land but it increased erosion and decreased soil fertility . This was due to deeper plow cuts in the soil that allowed the soil more contact with oxygen causing nutrient depletion . In grazing fields , the large number of cattle in the New England , the soil was being compacted by the cattle and this did not give the soil enough oxygen to sustain life . In the United States , farms spread from the colonies westward along with the settlers . In cooler regions , wheat was often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled , leading to a `` wheat frontier '' that moved westward over the course of years . Also very common in the antebellum Midwest was farming corn while raising hogs , complementing each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the canals and railroads . After the `` wheat frontier '' had passed through an area , more diversified farms including dairy cattle generally took its place . Warmer regions saw plantings of cotton and herds of beef cattle . In the early colonial south , raising tobacco and cotton was common , especially through the use of slave labor until the Civil War . In the northeast , slaves were used in agriculture until the early 19th century . In the Midwest , slavery was prohibited by the Freedom Ordinance of 1787 . The introduction and broad adoption of scientific agriculture since the mid-19th century contributed to economic growth in the United States . This development was facilitated by the Morrill Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 which established in each state a land - grant university ( with a mission to teach and study agriculture ) and a federally funded system of agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension networks which place extension agents in each state . Soybeans were not widely cultivated in the United States until the early 1930s , and by 1942 it became the world 's largest soybean producer , due in part to World War II and the `` need for domestic sources of fats , oils , and meal '' . Between 1930 and 1942 , the United States ' share of world soybean production skyrocketed from 3 % to 46.5 % , and by 1969 it had risen to 76 % . By 1973 soybeans were the United States ' `` number one cash crop , and leading export commodity , ahead of both wheat and corn '' . Significant areas of farmland were abandoned during the Great Depression and incorporated into nascent national forests . Later , `` Sodbuster '' and `` Swampbuster '' restrictions written into federal farm programs starting in the 1970s reversed a decades - long trend of habitat destruction that began in 1942 when farmers were encouraged to plant all possible land in support of the war effort . In the United States , federal programs administered through local Soil and Water Conservation Districts provide technical assistance and partial funding to farmers who wish to implement management practices to conserve soil and limit erosion and floods .

Inventory data is not as readily available as for the major industries . For the three major goat - producing states -- Arizona , New Mexico , and Texas -- there were 1.2 million goats at the end of 2002 . There were 5.3 million horses in the United States at the end of 1998 . There were 2.5 million colonies of bees at the end of 2002 . Farm type or majority enterprise type ( edit ) Farm type is based on which commodities are the majority crops grown on a farm . Nine common types include : Cash grains includes corn , soybeans and other grains ( wheat , oats , barley , sorghum ) , dry edible beans , peas , and rice . Tobacco Cotton Other field crops includes peanuts , potatoes , sunflowers , sweet potatoes , sugarcane , broomcorn , popcorn , sugar beets , mint , hops , seed crops , hay , silage , forage , etc . Tobacco and cotton can be included here if not in their own separate category . High - value crops includes fruits , vegetables , melons , tree nuts , greenhouse , nursery crops , and horticultural specialties . Cattle Hogs Dairy Poultry and eggs Governance ( edit ) Agriculture subsidy , from a Congressional Budget Office report . Note : chart does not show sugar subsidies . Main articles : Agricultural policy in the United States and Agricultural subsidy Agriculture in the United States is primarily governed by periodically renewed U.S. farm bills . Governance is both a federal and a local responsibility with the United States Department of Agriculture being the federal department responsible . Government aid includes research into crop types and regional suitability as well as many kinds of subsidies , some price supports and loan programs . U.S. farmers are not subject to production quotas and some laws are different for farms compared to other workplaces . Labor laws prohibiting children in other workplaces provide some exemptions for children working on farms with complete exemptions for children working on their family 's farm . Children can also gain permits from vocational training schools or the 4 - H club which allow them to do jobs they would otherwise not be permitted to do . A large part of the U.S. farm workforce is made up of migrant and seasonal workers , many of them recent immigrants from Latin America . Additional laws apply to these workers and their housing which is often provided by the farmer . Employment ( edit ) In 1870 , almost 50 percent of the US population was employed in agriculture . As of 2008 , less than 2 percent of the population is directly employed in agriculture . In 2012 , there were 3.2 million farmers , ranchers and other agricultural managers and an estimated 757,900 agricultural workers were legally employed in the US . Animal breeders accounted for 11,500 of those workers with the rest categorized as miscellaneous agricultural workers . According to a study the farm laborers declined by 20 % between 2002 and 2014 . The median pay was $9.12 per hour or $18,970 per year . In 2009 , about 519,000 people under age 20 worked on farms owned by their family . In addition to the youth who lived on family farms , an additional 230,000 youth were employed in agriculture . In 2004 , women made up approximately 24 % of farmers ; that year , there were 580,000 women employed in agriculture , forestry , and fishing . From 1999 - 2009 , roughly 50 % of hired crop farmworkers in the US were noncitizens working without legal authorization . Occupational Safety and Health ( edit ) Main article : Agricultural safety and health Agriculture ranks among the most hazardous industries due to the use of chemicals and risk of injury . Farmers are at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries ( general traumatic injury and musculoskeletal injury ) , work - related lung diseases , noise - induced hearing loss , skin diseases , chemical - related illnesses , and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure . In an average year , 516 workers die doing farm work in the U.S. ( 1992 -- 2005 ) . Every day , about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost - work - time injuries , and about 5 % of these result in permanent impairment . Tractor overturns are the leading cause of agriculture - related fatal injuries , and account for over 90 deaths every year . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of roll over protection structures on tractors to reduce the risk of overturn - related fatal injuries . Farming is one of the few industries in which families ( who often share the work and live on the premises ) are also at risk for injuries , illness , and death . Agriculture is the most dangerous industry for young workers , accounting for 42 % of all work - related fatalities of young workers in the U.S. between 1992 and 2000 . In 2011 , 108 youth , less than 20 years of age , died from farm - related injuries . Unlike other industries , half the young victims in agriculture were under age 15 . For young agricultural workers aged 15 -- 17 , the risk of fatal injury is four times the risk for young workers in other workplaces Agricultural work exposes young workers to safety hazards such as machinery , confined spaces , work at elevations , and work around livestock . The most common causes of fatal farm - related youth injuries involve machinery , motor vehicles , or drowning . Together these three causes comprise more than half of all fatal injuries to youth on U.S. farms . Women in agriculture ( including the related industries of forestry and fishing ) numbered 556,000 in 2011 . Agriculture in the US makes up approximately 75 % of the country 's pesticide use . Agricultural workers are at high risk for being exposed to dangerous levels of pesticides , whether or not they are directly working with the chemicals . Research centers ( edit ) Some US research centers are focused on the topic of health and safety in agricultural practices . These centers not only conduct research on the subject of occupational disease and injury prevention , but also promote agricultural health and safety through educational outreach programs . Most of these groups are funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , the US Department of Agriculture , or other state agencies . Centers include : Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health , University of Nebraska Medical Center , Omaha , NE Great Plains Center for Agricultural Health , University of Iowa , Iowa City , IA High Plains Intermountain Center for Agricultural Health and Safety , Colorado State University , Fort Collins , CO National Children 's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety , Marshfield , WI Northeast Center for Agricultural and Occupational Health , New York Center for Agricultural Medicine and Health , Cooperstown , NY Pacific Northwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center , University of Washington , Seattle , WA Southeast Center for Agricultural Health and Injury Prevention , University of Kentucky , Lexington , KY Southwest Center for Agricultural Health , Injury Prevention and Education , University of Texas , Tyler , TX Upper Midwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center , a collaboration between the University of Minnesota School of Public Health , Minneapolis , MN , University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine , St. Paul , MN , Minnesota Department of Health , St. Paul , MN and the National Farm Medicine Center , Marshfield , WI with Migrant Clinicians Network , Salisbury , MD Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety , University of California , Davis , CA Women in agriculture ( edit ) It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled Women In Agriculture - United States . ( Discuss ) ( November 2016 ) Women who work in agriculture face different occupational hazards than men . Women in agriculture are poisoned by pesticides at twice the rate of their male counterparts . Exposure to pesticides can also affect fertility ; women exposed to pesticides take longer to conceive ( men are unaffected ) . Women are also at risk for bronchitis from exposure to grain , pesticides , and dust . Pesticide exposure in relationship to female agricultural workers ( edit ) In many developing countries worldwide , women make up a significant proportion of agricultural workers , accounting for between 44 - 75 % of agricultural workers , depending on which country is being examined . In developed countries , approximately 36 % of the entire agricultural workforce are women , with approximately one in five agricultural workers in the United States being women . Women agricultural workers in the United States are exposed to various categories of pesticides , which include insecticides , fungicides , disinfectants , herbicides , and fumigants . These pesticides are applied in order to protect a multitude of crops , including but not limited to , fruits , vegetables , grains , and fiber crops . The exposures can occur via application as well as residues left in the soil and on the crops after application has occurred ; pesticide may also be present in ambient air . Women may acquire acute pesticide poisoning , which has classified as being based on three criteria . These criteria include the strength of evidence that a pesticide exposure occurred , whether adverse health effects were observed by a healthcare professional , and if there is sufficient evidence that the known toxicology of the agent was consistent with the observed health effects . The WHO defines acute pesticide poisoning as any illness or health effect resulting from suspected or confirmed exposure to a pesticide within 48 hours . Female agricultural workers are less likely to wear Personal Protective Equipment , which is made of chemical resistance material that prevents chemicals from coming in contact with skin for a limited period of time , . Only 51 % of women pesticide handlers utilize PPE , while 26 % of women non-handlers use PPE ; this is significantly less than male workers in the agricultural field and is largely a result of ill - fitting equipment , including glasses , gloves , respirators , and protective outerwear , . Acute Pesticide Poisoning Case Definition Matrix Health effects ( edit ) Surveillance for occupational pesticide - related illnesses and injuries are tracked by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) and the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) through the SENSOR - Pesticides program . The EPA estimates between 10,000 - 20,000 physician related pesticide poisonings are reported among hired US agricultural workers each year . `` While poisonings comprise a relatively small portion of total agricultural worker occupational illness , this is likely underestimated due to inadequate state surveillance programs , lack of physician training to recognize poisonings , lack of health insurance among farm workers , worker reluctance to report poisonings , and the transient nature of agricultural workers '' . Female agricultural workers face the same potential acute exposure and chronic conditions as do their male counterparts . Acute Exposure Conditions dizziness ; confusion ; abnormal skin sensations ; contact dermatitis ; eye irritation ; chest tightness ; gastrointestinal problems ; vomiting ; convulsions ; and even death in cases of acute exposure . Chronic Conditions dermatological sensitivity ; respiratory disease including lung fibrosis and chronic bronchitis ; asthma - like syndromes ; cancer ; and neurological symptoms . The issue of preconceptional prenatal exposure is another factor in the health of female agricultural workers . It has been documented in the literature that pesticide exposure before or during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of infertility , perinatal death , spontaneous abortion / stillbirth , premature birth , and congenital malformations . These health ramifications not only impact the physical and mental health of women but also future generations . Epigenetic effects ( edit ) The female agricultural workers are not the only ones that suffer damage from pesticide exposure . Husbands of the agricultural worker as well as the children and grandchildren and great - grandchildren are also affected . This is due to exposure to Organophosphorus Pesticides because they have been shown to cause damage to DNA in sperm cells . When DNA damage is done in gamete cells ( sperm and egg cells ) then the future generations will all be affected . The damage may not cause any noticeable abnormalities in the development of the child born to a father with sperm cell DNA damage . However , it could lead to such serious complications as Autism ( caused by chromosomal abnormalities ) or Leukemia . Female agricultural workers that are exposed to pesticides can expose their family members by bringing home some of the pesticides from work on their clothes , or skin . The husband 's DNA can be compromised through this exposure pathway , as well as any other children already born and living in the house . Scientific limitations ( edit ) The two most common limitations in studying the health effects of pesticide exposure in women are the small sample sizes and the lack of toxicological data , . Ensuring that the proper exposure is measured relies heavily on the study participants not moving residences throughout the study period . However , this is nearly impossible because migrant workers and seasonal employees do not typically live in the same place throughout the year . Scientific studies require consistency within the group of participants being studied so that confounders are adjusted for , and transient residents do not make for very consistent study participants . Such living arrangements also make agricultural workers difficult to get in contact with . The most common methods for scientific researchers to find a person 's contact information are not available for these populations . Health insurance information is not available and contact information left with an employer may not be correct year - round . Additionally , there is a very limited amount of quantifiable data on the pesticides the study participants are exposed to . The specific names of the pesticides may not be available . The units of pesticide applied per field may not accurately represent the units that a worker is exposed to . The number of days or hours that an agricultural worker is exposed is rarely recorded . This is due to the inconsistencies in the end of an agricultural work day practices - such as removing work clothing before going home , showering before going home , etc . Additionally , the proximity of agricultural workers ' homes to the fields they harvest results in more exposure to the pesticides , and the amount of exposure at home is even more difficult to measure . Challenges and means of exposure ( edit ) Occupational Safety ( edit ) In addition to the scientific limitations regarding pesticide exposure data , a variety of challenges exist in the industry for female farmworkers . Occupational safety measures are not always well defined and rarely enforced . This means that not all laborers are subject to safety training through their provider . Furthermore , as many as 35 % of female farmworkers do not know of any health risks associated with pesticide spraying at all . When workers are unaware of best practices in pesticide application and the subsequent health risks , they are unable to protect themselves and their families appropriately from pesticide exposure . One of the first steps of protection against exposure is through personal protective equipment ( PPEs ) . However , PPEs are not regularly used and rarely includes all the recommended protective measures such as goggles and gloves . Some women also report not having the necessary equipment to mix the pesticides and ultimately resort to using household items like broomsticks or even their hands . Home Safety ( edit ) Home safety provides its own challenges for women . It is possible for non-laborers to be exposed to pesticides through clothing contamination . In order to maintain a safe home environment , clothing from spraying pesticides should be cleaned and stored separately from other clothing in the household . Exposure can also be limited by having workers shower within 15 minutes of returning home at the end of the work day . The pesticides used in the agricultural industry in the United States often have a strong odor that helps to remind families of the presence of toxins which makes it more likely that they PPEs and equipment will be stored appropriately . Family members are also subject to contamination through food and water supplies . Many people reported reusing pesticide containers for laundry or to carry water . Social determinants of Health ( edit ) Finally , all of these factors are compounded by social determinants affecting agricultural workers . Studies have shown that as many as 97 % of female farm laborers take their children with them to work , thereby directly exposing them to pesticide contamination . Farm workers have literacy rates significantly lower than the rest of the population . This negatively impacts health outcomes because employees that have not received safety training are not able to read the warning labels and instructions on the pesticides . In one study , `` Only 85 ( 23.2 % ) of the women could read English and 69 ( 18.9 % ) reported ever reading the pesticide labels . '' . Housing is usually cramped without adequate laundry or bathroom facilities to wash and store equipment . Such dwellings are often occupied by multiple laborers thereby multiplying the overall contaminants . Lastly , women in the agricultural industry report accessing prenatal health care services at nearly half the rate of the national average , 42 % vs. 76 % , respectively . Socioeconomic challenges ( edit ) Female farm workers may often face social challenges and adverse mental health effects while working , with one of the biggest challenges being social inequality . The number of women working in agriculture has risen and the 2002 census of agriculture recorded a 40 % increase in the number of female farm workers . Inequality and respect are common issues for these workers , as many have reported that they are not being respected , listened to , or taken seriously due to traditional views of women as housewives and caretakers . Women may also face resistance when attempting to advance to higher positions . Other issues reported by female farm workers include receiving less pay than their male counterparts and a refusal or reluctance by their employers to offer their female workers the same additional benefits given to male workers such as housing . This inequality in pay can cause some women to seek off - farm jobs , which can be difficult if the women are older or have no education or related experience . The risk of injury for farm workers is high . Studies have shown that safety recautions and regulations tend to focus on the male 's work because of the traditional idea that the male farm workers work is more dangerous and risky than the females , despite women also engaging in equally risky work such as caring for farm animals or using farming machinery . Women in the farming industry are more likely than men to experience depression and women who experience higher rates of depression are more likely to have been through traumatic events such as sexual abuse and stress due to gender inequality . They are also at a disadvantage when beginning farm work due to some female workers lacking knowledge about the chemical hazards on farms , which can pose issues for pregnant farm workers who are exposed to chemicals that can harm the pregnancy . Some farm workers may also be immigrants who may not be educated on the importance of prenatal care , especially when being exposed to harmful chemicals , which can cause them to experience complications during pregnancy and have children born with birth defects . Policy Implications ( edit ) Protection of women 's reproductive health is needed for female agricultural workers . Farm work is one of three most dangerous occupations in the United States . According to the National Agricultural Workers Survey ( 1994 - 1995 ) , the proportion of women in farming declined from 25 % in the 1980s to less than 20 % in the 1990s . As a result of `` a larger portion of the farm worker population being U.S. born ( 1994 - 1995 ) which means that every third U.S. born farm worker was a woman while only one in eight foreign - born farm workers was a woman . '' Due to their occupation , women and their families are at risk to higher exposure from pesticides than the general population from direct contact and pesticide drift as result of their housing proximity to agricultural lands . To ensure the safety and health of women , they need additional surveillance and monitoring for any toxic effects caused by working and living in close proximity to commercial spraying operations , . Moreover , this is important to women 's reproductive health , because the quality of healthcare they receive in the United States during their lifespan has a direct impact on their reproductive health and well - being and that of their US - born children , . Furthermore , `` U.S. born workers , women tended to be older than their male counterparts ( 32 and 25 years old , respectively ) while among the foreign - born farm workers , there was no meaningful difference in age between men and women ( 29 and 30 years old , respectively ) . '' The key issues confronting women in agriculture 's healthcare are : access to health care ; lack of affordable health insurance ; and lack of a medical home due to the seasonality of the work which forces migrant workers to follow the crops . Increased enforcement and compliance of existing EPA 's Worker Protection Standards is needed to protect women workers from pesticide exposures as well as new policies that specifically address women 's reproductive health and to their families and unborn children . This is complicated due to the composition of the workforce which consists primarily of migrants with a mixed immigrant status and the United States government 's policies about not providing nonemergency health care to nonresidents . This includes prenatal care for undocumented workers whose child born in the United States is considered an American by the 14 Amendment of the US Constitution or the Citizenship Clause . Additional work on compliance onsite by OSHA .
