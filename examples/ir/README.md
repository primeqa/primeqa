## Dense retrieval

We support ColBERT-based Information Retrieval engine, as described in [README](../../primeqa/ir/dense/colbert_top/README.md).

This README shows how to run the basic model training, data indexing, retrieval, and scoring steps, using the `run_ir.py` script.  The steps involved in training a model using the DR.DECR (Dense Retrieval with Distillation-Enhanced Cross-Lingual Representation) Student/Teacher pipeline, as desribed in [Learning Cross-Lingual IR from an English Retriever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08185), are outlined in the [Jupyter notebook](../../notebooks/ir/dense/dense_ir_student_teacher.ipynb).


The following steps require PrimeQA to be [installed](../../README.md#Installation).
Sample data files are [here](../../tests/resources/ir_dense), their formats are shown in the Jupyter notebooks [here](../../notebooks/ir/dense/dense_ir.ipynb) and [here](../../notebooks/ir/dense/dense_ir_student_teacher.ipynb).

### Model Training

Here is an example of a training run for a Question Anwering model, using a training data .tsv file containing training examples in the form of \<query>, <positive_passage>, <negative_passage> triples.

```shell
python examples/ir/run_ir.py \
    --do_train \
    --engine_type ColBERT \
    --amp \
    --doc_maxlen 180 \
    --bsize 192 \
    --accum 6 \
    --maxsteps 100000 \
    --save_steps 20000
    --mask-punctuation \
    --lr 6e-06 \
    --similarity l2 \
    --model_type xlm-roberta-base \
    --triples <training_data> \
    --root <experiments_root_directory> \
    --experiment <experiment_label> 
```

The trained model is stored in `<experiments_root_directory>/<experiment_label>/none/<year_month/<day>/<time>/checkpoints/colbert-LAST.dnn`, with intermediate model files in the same `checkpoints` directory.
 
### Indexing

Here is an example of an indexing run, using a model as trained in the previous step.

```shell
python examples/ir/run_ir.py \
    --do_index \
    --engine_type ColBERT \
    --doc_maxlen 180 \
    --mask-punctuation \
    --bsize 256 \
    --similarity l2 \
    --checkpoint <model_checkpoint> \
    --collection <document_collection> \
    --root <experiments_root_directory> \
    --experiment <experiment_label> \ 
    --index_name <index_label> \
    --compression_level 2
```

The index is stored in `<experiments_root_directory>/<experiment_label>/<index_label>` directory.

### Retrieval

Here is an example of a retrieval (search) run, using a model and index as created in the previous two steps.

```shell
python examples/ir/run_ir.py \
    --do_search \
    --engine_type ColBERT \
    --amp \
    --doc_maxlen 180 \
    --mask-punctuation \
    --bsize 16 \
    --similarity l2 \
    --retrieve_only \
    --queries <query_file> \
    --checkpoint <model_checkpoint> \
    --collection <document_collection> \
    --root <experiments_root_directory> \
    --experiment <experiment_label> \ 
    --index_name <index_label> \
    --index_name ${EXPT}_indname \
    --ranks_fn <scores_and_ranks> \
    --nprobe 4
```

The resulting .tsv file, containing query IDs, document IDs, ranks, and scores is stored in `<scores_and_ranks>`.

### Scoring

The scoring steps depend on the task and metric used. 

For cross-lingual question answering, as in the [XOR-TyDi task](https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/xorqa/), we need to convert the scores in  `<scores_and_ranks>` into the format used in the task.  This is done by running the conversion script:

```shell
    python primeqa/ir/scripts/xortydi/convert_colbert_results_to_xor.pyconvert_colbert_results_to_xor.py \
    -c <document_collection> \
    -q <ground_truth_data>
    -p <scores_and_ranks> \
    -o <xor_scores> 
```

The `<ground_truth_data>` file can be downloaded as described [here](./README.md#run-bm25-search-on-xortydi-dev-set-queries).
The resulting `<xor_scores>` file can be evaluated as described [here](./README.md#evaluate-xortydi-bm25-ranked-results).



## Sparse retrieval

Sparse retrieval is based on BM25 ranking using bag of words representation. It is built on Pyserini which is built on Lucene.  

The ```PyseriniRetriever``` class provides the entry point for running queries against an index.

The instructions below are for creating an index of English Wikipedia passage and use the index to search 
and evaluate performance on the Google translation of the XORTyDI DEV set queries. 

### Java SDK Dependency
Pyserini requires Java 11
Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the path where the Java SDK is installed 

### PyseriniRetriever usage
Here's how to run a search query against an index and retrieve ranked list of documents:


```

from primeqa.ir.sparse.retriever import PyseriniRetriever

index_path='<path-to-wikipedia-passage-index>
searcher = PyseriniRetriever(index_path, use_bm25=True, k1=0.9, b=0.4)

query = 'What is the largest region of Germany?'
top_n = 5

hits = searcher.retrieve(query,top_n)

for hit in hits:
   print(f"{hit['rank']} {hit['doc_id']} {hit['score']}  {hit['title']} {hit['text']}")

```

Output:

```

Lenggries is the center of the Isarwinkel, the region along the Isar between Bad Tölz and Wallgau. The town has about 9,500 inhabitants. By area, it is the largest rural municipality ("Gemeinde") in what was formerly West Germany, and the 7th-largest overall. (All six currently larger "Gemeinden" are in Brandenburg.) The name Lenggries is derived from "Lenngengrieze" (long Gries), a long rubble field with deposits of debris from the bed of the Isar.

Located on a hill overlooking the Main river outside the city of Würzburg, the vineyard is responsible for what may have been the oldest wine ever tasted. In addition to being one of Germany's oldest winemaking sites, at 85 hectares (210 acres), the vineyard is also one of Germany's largest individual plots. Today the vineyard is one of the warmest sites in the Franconia wine region and is planted

### Create an Pyserini index of Wikipedia passages for XORTyDI
1. Download the DPR corpus of English Wikpedia (December 20, 2018 dump) split 100 word passages 
   wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dpr/wikipedia_split/psgs_w100.tsv.gz
2. Format as JSON
    python convert_corpus_tsv_to_pyserini_jsonl.py --input <psgs_w100_file> --output <output_dir>
3. Build the Pyserini index
   ```
   python -m pyserini.index.lucene --collection JsonCollection --input <psgs_w100_jsonl-dir> --generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator --threads 1 --storePositions --storeDocvectors --storeRaw --index <index-dir>
   ```

### Run BM25 search on XORTyDI DEV set queries 
1. Download and unzip the English MT translation of XORTyDI DEV queries from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JzlNDijDZmDlT42ABVJK53gwk7_mKHGt/view?usp=sharing). 
2. Convert to ColBERT tsv format 
```shell
   python primeqa/ir/scripts/xortydi/convert_xorqa_jsonl_to_tsv.py --queries_jsonl_file <path-to-xortydi-gmt-queries-jsonl> --output_file <path-to-xortydi-dev-gmt-queries.tsv> 
 ```
3. Run:
  ```shell
   python examples/ir/run_bm25_retrieval.py \
   --output_dir <output-dir> --index_path <path-to-psgs_w100_index> \
   --queries_file <xortydi-dev-gmt-queries.tsv> --top_k 1000 \
   --max_hits_to_output 100 --xorqa_data_file <xortydi-queries-jsonl>
  ```
4. This will produce 2 files in the output directory:
   - ranking.tsv in ColBERT ranking output format
   - ranking_xortydi_format.json in XORTyDI format
