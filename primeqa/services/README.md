# PrimeQA Services

This contains support for deploying PrimeQA capabiities such as retrieval and machine reading comprehension as microservices. Both gRPC and REST interfaces are supported. 

## Setup

Before continuing below make sure you have PrimeQA [installed](https://primeqa.github.io/primeqa/installation.html).

<h3>ðŸ“œ TLS and Certificate Management</h3>

PrimeQA service gRPC and REST server supports mutual or two-way TLS authentication (also known as mTLS). Application's [config.ini](./config/config.ini) file contains the default certificate paths, but they can be overridden using environment variables.

Self-signed certificates are generated and packaged with the Docker build.
Self-signed certs _may be_ required for local development and testing. If you want to generate them, follow the steps below:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Make neccessary directories
mkdir -p security/
mkdir -p security/certs/
mkdir -p security/certs/ca security/certs/server security/certs/client

# Generate CA key and CA cert
openssl req -x509 -days 365 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Yorktown Heights/O=IBM/OU=Research/CN=example.com" -keyout security/certs/ca/ca.key -out security/certs/ca/ca.crt

# Generate Server key (without passphrase) and Server cert signing request
openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Yorktown Heights/O=IBM/OU=Research/CN=example.com" -keyout security/certs/server/server.key -out security/certs/server/server.csr

# Sign Server cert
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in security/certs/server/server.csr -CA security/certs/ca/ca.crt -CAkey security/certs/ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out security/certs/server/server.crt

# Generate Client key (without passphrase) and Client cert signing request
openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Yorktown Heights/O=IBM/OU=Research/CN=example.com" -keyout security/certs/client/client.key -out security/certs/client/client.csr

# Sign Client cert
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in security/certs/client/client.csr -CA security/certs/ca/ca.crt -CAkey security/certs/ca/ca.key -CAserial security/certs/ca/ca.srl -out security/certs/client/client.crt

# Delete signing requests
rm -rf security/certs/server/server.csr
rm -rf security/certs/client/client.csr
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- By default, PrimeQA services are set up to run without SSL. We recommend that you set up certificats and update the config.ini and set `require_ssl` to `true`. The application tries to load certs from `/opt/tls`. You will need to update appropriate `tls_*` variables in [`config.ini`](./config/config.ini) during local use.

- We recommend to generate certificates with official signing authority and use them via volume mounts in the application container.

<h2>ðŸ›  Build & Deployment </h2>
<h3>ðŸ’» Config</h3>
Please see the default values in [here](./config/config.ini). These can be overridden using environment variables.

- By default, the service starts as a `grpc` service. Set the <b>mode</b> to `rest` to start as a REST server. 
- By default, `require_ssl` is set to false.
- Set the `grpc_port` and/or `rest_port` to a free port number.

<h3>ðŸ’» Local</h3> 

- Update config [here](./config/config.ini).
- Open [application.py](./application.py) and run/debug

This will start a `ReaderService`, a `IndexerService`, a `RetrieverService`, a `RerankerService` and the following lines will be displayed:

gRPC service:
```
{"time":"2023-03-21 23:38:33,628", "name": "GrpcServer", "level": "INFO", "message": "Server instance started on port 50055 - initialization took 0 seconds"}
```

REST service:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:50056 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
{"time":"2023-03-21 23:39:48,024", "name": "uvicorn.error", "level": "INFO", "message": "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:50056 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"}
```
- Use one of the [Clients](#clients) to send requests to the service.

<h3>ðŸ’» Docker</h3>

Please verify if Docker is properly setup with `docker run hello-world`

<h4> Build Docker Image </h4>

```
docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.cpu -t primeqa:$(cat VERSION) --build-arg image_version:$(cat VERSION) .
```
<h4> Run Container </h4>

The container needs write access to a `cache` directory e.g. `$HOME/.cache/` for caching Huggingface model and datasets.  Additionally, it will need write access to a `store` directory, e.g. `$PWD/store/` for custom models and index creation. 

See [Store](./store)

```
chmod -R 777 $HOME/.cache/
chmod -R 777 $PWD/store/
```

To start a `gRPC` service, run the following command, replace `<host-port>` with a free port number:

```
docker run --rm --name primeqa -it -p <host-port>:50051 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/store,target=/store --mount type=bind,source="$HOME"/.cache/huggingface/,target=/cache/huggingface/ -e STORE_DIR=/store -e mode=grpc -e require_ssl=false primeqa:$(cat VERSION)
```

To start a `rest` service, run the following command, replace `<host-port>` with a free port number:

```
docker run --rm --name primeqa -it -p <host-port>:50052 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/store,target=/store --mount type=bind,source="$HOME"/.cache/huggingface/,target=/cache/huggingface/ -e STORE_DIR=/store -e mode=rest -e require_ssl=false primeqa:$(cat VERSION)
```

WARNING: The PrimeQA orchestrator and UI will only work with gRPC deployment without SSL. The parameter `require-ssl` must be set to `false`.

<h3>ðŸ’» Store</h3>

The `primeqa store` provides a location for dropping in your own models, index and checkpoints. The store directory within the container is mounted at `/store`.  The directory structure is as follows:

```
store
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoints
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ <dense-ir-checkpoint-name>
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ <checkpoint-file>
â”œâ”€â”€ indexes
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ <collection-name>
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ documents.sqlite
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ documents.tsv
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ index
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ information.json
â””â”€â”€ models
    â””â”€â”€ <reader-model-name>
        â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ pytorch_model.bin
        â””â”€â”€ tokenizer.json
```
### Drop in a Reader model 

Create a directory under `models` and copy `pytorch_model.bin`, `config.json` and `tokenizer.json` files into the direcotory.

### Drop in a Reranker model 

The [ColBERTReranker](../components/reranker/colbert_reranker.py) requires a ColBERT checkpoint/model file. 
Create a subdirectory under `checkpoints` and copy the checkpoint/model file in that subdirectory.

### Drop in a Dense IR index and checkpoint 

- Create a directory under `checkpoints` and copy the checkpoint file, e.g. a ColBERT dnn or DPR model file,  here.  

- Create a directory under indexes with a unique name for the collection `<collection-name>`. Place the following files in the directory:
  1. `documents.tsv` a tsv file contains the passages that were indexed. The format is `id\ttext\ttitle`.  
  2. `index` is a directory containing the index
  3. Create `documents.sqlite` by running the following python code from `indexes/<collection-name>` directory. This file is required to fetch the document text.

      ```
      from sqlitedict import SqliteDict
      import csv
      
      documents_tsv_file_path = "documents.tsv"
      documents_sqlite_file_path = "documents.sqlite"

      with open(documents_tsv_file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as documents_file, SqliteDict(
        documents_sqlite_file_path, tablename="documents"
      ) as documents_db:
          csv_reader = csv.DictReader(documents_file, fieldnames=["id", "text", "title"], delimiter="\t")
          next(csv_reader)
          for row in csv_reader:
              assert len(row) == 3 or len(row) == 2, f'Invalid .tsv record (has to contain 2 or 3 fields): {row}'
              documents_db[row["id"]] = {
                  "document_id": row["id"],
                  "text": row["text"],
                  "title": row["title"] if len(row) == 3 else None
              }
          # Commit to save documents_db
          documents_db.commit()
      ```

  4. Create the file `information.json` and add the following information into the file:

  ```
      {
        "index_id": "<collection-name>",
        "status": "READY",
        "configuration": {
          "engine_type": "<engine_type>",  # select one of "BM25", "ColBERT" or "DPR"
          "checkpoint": "<checkpoint>"     # Set this to the folder name where the checkpoint is stored.
        }
      }
  ```

  NOTE: `engine_type` is a now required for all Retrievers.  If you have an existing information.json file, please add this field. `checkpoint` is required for DPR and ColBERT Retrievers.

  ```
  - The index is now available for search
