# PrimeQA Services

This contains support for deploying PrimeQA capabiities such as retrieval and machine reading comprehension as microservices. Both gRPC and REST interfaces are supported. 

## Setup

Before continuing below make sure you have PrimeQA [installed](https://primeqa.github.io/primeqa/installation.html).

<h3>ðŸ“œ TLS and Certificate Management</h3>

PrimeQA service gRPC and REST server supports mutual or two-way TLS authentication (also known as mTLS). Application's [config.ini](./config/config.ini) file contains the default certificate paths, but they can be overridden using environment variables.

Self-signed certificates are generated and packaged with the Docker build.
Self-signed certs _may be_ required for local development and testing. If you want to generate them, follow the steps below:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Make neccessary directories
mkdir -p security/
mkdir -p security/certs/
mkdir -p security/certs/ca security/certs/server security/certs/client

# Generate CA key and CA cert
openssl req -x509 -days 365 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Yorktown Heights/O=IBM/OU=Research/CN=example.com" -keyout security/certs/ca/ca.key -out security/certs/ca/ca.crt

# Generate Server key (without passphrase) and Server cert signing request
openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Yorktown Heights/O=IBM/OU=Research/CN=example.com" -keyout security/certs/server/server.key -out security/certs/server/server.csr

# Sign Server cert
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in security/certs/server/server.csr -CA security/certs/ca/ca.crt -CAkey security/certs/ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out security/certs/server/server.crt

# Generate Client key (without passphrase) and Client cert signing request
openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:4096 -subj "/C=US/ST=New York/L=Yorktown Heights/O=IBM/OU=Research/CN=example.com" -keyout security/certs/client/client.key -out security/certs/client/client.csr

# Sign Client cert
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in security/certs/client/client.csr -CA security/certs/ca/ca.crt -CAkey security/certs/ca/ca.key -CAserial security/certs/ca/ca.srl -out security/certs/client/client.crt

# Delete signing requests
rm -rf security/certs/server/server.csr
rm -rf security/certs/client/client.csr
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- By default, PrimeQA services are set up to run without SSL. We recommend that you set up certificats and update the config.ini and set `require_ssl` to `true`. The application tries to load certs from `/opt/tls`. You will need to update appropriate `tls_*` variables in [`config.ini`](./config/config.ini) during local use.

- We recommend to generate certificates with official signing authority and use them via volume mounts in the application container.

<h2>ðŸ›  Build & Deployment </h2>
<h3>ðŸ’» Config</h3>
Please see the default values in [here](./config/config.ini). These can be overridden using environment variables.

- By default, the service starts as a `grpc` service. Set the <b>mode</b> to `rest` to start as a REST server. 
- By default, `require_ssl` is set to false.
- Set the `grpc_port` and/or `rest_port` to a free port number.

<h3>ðŸ’» Local</h3> 

- Update config [here](./config/config.ini).
- Open [application.py](./application.py) and run/debug

This will start a `ReaderService`, a `IndexerService` and a `RetrieverService` and the following lines will be displayed:

```
{"time":"2022-10-20 12:14:01,814", "name": "ReaderService", "level": "INFO", "message": "ReaderService is successfully initialized."}
{"time":"2022-10-20 12:14:01,815", "name": "IndexerService", "level": "INFO", "message": "IndexerService is successfully initialized."}
{"time":"2022-10-20 12:14:01,815", "name": "RetrieverService", "level": "INFO", "message": "RetrieverService is successfully initialized."}
I1020 12:14:01.815917763 2539136 socket_utils_common_posix.cc:353] TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is available. TCP_USER_TIMEOUT will be used thereafter
{"time":"2022-10-20 12:14:01,817", "name": "GrpcServer", "level": "INFO", "message": "Server instance started on port 50055 - initialization took 0 seconds"}
```
- Use one of the [Clients](./Clients) to send requests to the service.

<h3>ðŸ’» Docker</h3>

Please verify if Docker is properly setup with `docker run hello-world`

<h4> Build Docker Image </h4>

```
docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile.cpu -t primeqa:$(cat VERSION) --build-arg image_version:$(cat VERSION) .
```
<h4> Run Container </h4>

The container needs write access to a cache directory for caching Huggingface model and datasets.  Additionally will need write access to a store directory for index creation. 

```
chmod -R 777 $HOME/.cache/
chmod -R 777 $PWD/store/
```

To start a `gRPC` service, run the following command, replace `<host-port>` with a free port number:
`
docker run --rm --name primeqa -it -p <host-port>:50051 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/store,target=/store --mount type=bind,source="$HOME"/.cache/huggingface/,target=/cache/huggingface/ -e STORE_DIR=/store -e mode=grpc -e require_ssl=false primeqa:$(cat VERSION)
`

To start a `rest` service, run the following command, replace `<host-port>` with a free port number:

`
docker run --rm --name primeqa -it -p <host-port>:50052 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/store,target=/store --mount type=bind,source="$HOME"/.cache/huggingface/,target=/cache/huggingface/ -e STORE_DIR=/store -e mode=rest -e require_ssl=false primeqa:$(cat VERSION)
`

WARNING: The PrimeQA orchestrator and UI will only work with gRPC deployment without SSL. The parameter `require-ssl` must be set to `false`.

<h3>ðŸ’» Clients</h3>

<h4>Python</h4>
Refer to the [PrimeQA Orchestrator](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa-orchestrator) for examples on how to make gRPC calls via python.

<h4>GUI</h4>

[BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc) is a decent GUI gRPC client.

<h4>REST</h4>

Go to http://localhost:{rest_port}/docs

Example CURL to send a request to the `ExtractiveReader`

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://9.59.199.84:50057/answers' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "reader": {
    "reader_id": "ExtractiveReader"
  },
