PrimeQA is a public open source repository that enables researchers and developers to train state-of-the-art models for question answering (QA). By using PrimeQA, a researcher can replicate the experiments outlined in a paper published in the latest NLP conference while also enjoying the capability to download pre-trained models (from an online repository) and run them on their own custom data. PrimeQA is built on top of the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) toolkit and uses [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/) and [models](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA) that are directly downloadable.


The models within PrimeQA supports End-to-end Question Answering. PrimeQA answers questions via 
- [Information Retrieval](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/ir): Retrieving documents and passages using both traditional (e.g. BM25) and neural (e.g. ColBERT) models
- [Multilingual Machine Reading Comprehension](https://huggingface.co/ibm/tydiqa-primary-task-xlm-roberta-large): Extract and/ or generate answers given the source document or passage.
- [Multilingual Question Generation](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/mt5-base-tydi-question-generator): Supports generation of questions for effective domain adaptation over [tables](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/t5-base-table-question-generator) and [multilingual text](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/mt5-base-tydi-question-generator).

Some examples of models (applicable on benchmark datasets) supported are :
- [Traditional IR with BM25](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/ir/) Pyserini
- [Neural IR with ColBERT](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/ir), DPR (coming soon): to replicate the experiments that [Dr. Decr](https://huggingface.co/ibm/DrDecr_XOR-TyDi_whitebox) (Li et. al, 2022) performed to reach the top of the XOR TyDI leaderboard. Collaboration with [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) IR led by [Chris Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/) & [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
- [Machine Reading Comprehension with XLM-R](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/mrc): to replicate the experiments to get to the top of the TyDI leaderboard similar to the performance of the IBM GAAMA system. Coming soon: code to replicate GAAMA's performance on Natural Questions. 
- [Multimedia QA over news & movies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10728): coming soon! to replicate the experiments run over multi-hop QA over images, text over variety of domains. Collaboration with [UIUC Blender lab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/).



## ‚úîÔ∏è Getting Started

### Installation
[Installation doc](https://primeqa.github.io/primeqa/installation.html)       

```shell
# cd to project root

# If you want to run on GPU make sure to install torch appropriately

# E.g. for torch 1.11 + CUDA 11.3:
pip install 'torch~=1.11.0' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

# Install as editable (-e) or non-editable using pip, with extras (e.g. tests) as desired
# Example installation commands:

# Minimal install (non-editable)
pip install .

# Full install (editable)
pip install -e .[all]
```

Please note that dependencies (specified in [setup.py](./setup.py)) are pinned to provide a stable experience.
When installing from source these can be modified, however this is not officially supported.

### Install Tesseract
Follow the [instructions](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) to install tesseract. `Tesseract` is needed for running Visual Document question answering models.

### JAVA requirements
Java 11 is required for BM25 retrieval. 

Download Java 11 package from https://jdk.java.net/archive/ and uncompress

Set JAVA_HOME:
```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<jdk-dir>
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

## üß™ Unit Tests
[Testing doc](https://primeqa.github.io/primeqa/testing.html)       

To run the unit tests you first need to [install PrimeQA](#Installation).
Make sure to install with the `[tests]` or `[all]` extras from pip.

From there you can run the tests via pytest, for example:
```shell
pytest --cov PrimeQA --cov-config .coveragerc tests/
```

For more information, see:
- Our [tox.ini](./tox.ini)
- The [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) and [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) documentation
