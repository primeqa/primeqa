        "table_passage_row_old": "Emmitt James Smith III ( born May 15 , 1969 ) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for fifteen seasons in the National Football League ( NFL ) during the 1990s and 2000s , primarily with the Dallas Cowboys . A three-time Super Bowl champion with the Cowboys , he is the league 's all-time leading rusher . Smith grew up in Pensacola , Florida and became the second-leading rusher in American high school football history while playing for Escambia High School . Smith played three years of college football for the Florida Gators , where he set numerous school rushing records . After being named a unanimous All-American in 1989 , Smith chose to forgo his senior year of eligibility and play professionally . The Cowboys selected Smith in the first round of the 1990 NFL draft . During his long professional career , he rushed for 18,355 yards , breaking the record formerly held by Walter Payton . He also holds the record for career rushing touchdowns with 164 . Smith is the only running back to ever win a Super Bowl championship , the NFL Most Valuable Player award , the NFL rushing crown , and the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award all in the same season ( 1993 ) . He is also one of four running backs to lead the NFL in rushing three or more consecutive seasons , joining Steve Van Buren , Jim Brown and Earl Campbell . Smith led the league in rushing and won the Super Bowl in the same year three times ( 1992 , 1993 , and 1995 ) when to that point it had never been done . Smith is also one of only two non-kickers in NFL history to score more than 1,000 career points ( the other being Jerry Rice ) .The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex . The Cowboys compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's National Football Conference ( NFC ) East division . The team is headquartered in Frisco , Texas , and plays its home games at AT & T Stadium in Arlington , Texas , which opened for the 2009 season . The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season . The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960 . The team 's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs . The Cowboys ' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games ( home and away ) began in 2002 . The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times , tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances in history , just behind the New England Patriots record eleven Super Bowl appearances . This has also corresponded to eight NFC championships , most in the NFC . The Cowboys have won five of those Super Bowl appearances , tying them with their NFC rivals , the San Francisco 49ers ; both are second to Pittsburgh 's and New England 's record six Super Bowl championships . The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons ( 1966-85 ) , in which they missed the playoffs only twice ( 1974 and 1984 ) . In 2015 , the Dallas Cowboys became the first sports team to be valued at $ 4 billion , making it the most valuable sports team in the world , according to Forbes . The 1990 NFL season was the 71st regular season of the National Football League . To increase revenue , the league , for the first time since 1966 , reinstated bye weeks , so that all NFL teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period . Furthermore , the playoff format was expanded from 10 teams to 12 teams by adding another wild card from each conference , thus adding two more contests to the postseason schedule ; this format remains in use today ( although there are now four division spots and two wild card spots available with realignment in 2002 ) . During four out of the five previous seasons , at least one team with a 10-6 record missed the playoffs , including the 11-5 Denver Broncos in 1985 ; meanwhile , the 10-6 San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowl XXIII , leading for calls to expand the playoff format to ensure that 10-6 teams could compete for a Super Bowl win . Ironically , the first ever sixth-seeded playoff team would not have a 10-6 record , but instead , the New Orleans Saints , with an 8-8 record , took the new playoff spot . This was also the first full season for Paul Tagliabue as the league 's Commissioner , after taking over from Pete Rozelle midway through the previous season . ABC was given the rights to televise the two additional playoff games . Meanwhile , Turner 's TNT network started to broadcast Sunday night games for the first half of the season . On October 8 , the league announced that the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award would be named the Pete Rozelle Trophy . The season ended with Super Bowl XXV when the New York Giants defeated the Buffalo Bills 20-19 at Tampa Stadium . This would be the first Super Bowl appearance for Buffalo , who would lose the next three Super Bowls as well . Late in the season , with the Gulf War looming closer , the NFL announced that starting in Week 16 ( and continuing until Super Bowl XXV ) , the league would add American flag decals to the back of the helmet . The 2002 NFL season was the 83rd regular season of the National Football League . The league went back to an even number of teams , expanding to 32 teams with the addition of the Houston Texans ; the league has since remained static with 32 teams since . The clubs were then realigned into eight divisions , four teams in each . Also , the Chicago Bears played their home games in 2002 in Champaign , Illinois at Memorial Stadium because of the reconstruction of Soldier Field . The NFL title was eventually won by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when they defeated the Oakland Raiders 48-21 in Super Bowl XXXVII , at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego , California on January 26 , 2003 . The Arizona Cardinals are a professional American football franchise based in Phoenix , Arizona . They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) West division . The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898 , and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States . The Cardinals play their home games at State Farm Stadium , which opened in 2006 and is located in the northwestern suburb of Glendale . The team was established in Chicago in 1898 as an amateur football team and joined the NFL as a charter member on September 17 , 1920 . Along with the Chicago Bears , the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league 's founding ( the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL a year after its creation in 1921 ) . The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city through 1987 ( sometimes referred to as the Football Cardinals or the Big Red to avoid confusion with the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball ) . Before the 1988 season , the team moved west to Tempe , Arizona , a college suburb east of Phoenix , and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University . In 2006 , the club moved to their current home field in Glendale , although the team 's executive offices and training facility remain in Tempe . The franchise has won two NFL championships , both while it was based in Chicago . The first occurred in 1925 , but is the subject of controversy , with supporters of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have won the title . Their second title , and the first to be won in a championship game , came in 1947 , nearly two decades before the first Super Bowl . The 2003 NFL season was the 84th regular season of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Regular-season play was held from September 4 , 2003 , to December 28 , 2003 . Due to damage caused by the Cedar Fire , Qualcomm Stadium was used as an emergency shelter , and thus the Miami Dolphins-San Diego Chargers regular-season match on October 27 was instead played at Sun Devil Stadium , the home field of the Arizona Cardinals . The playoffs began on January 3 , 2004 . The NFL title was won by the New England Patriots when they defeated the Carolina Panthers , 32-29 , in Super Bowl XXXVIII at Reliant Stadium in Houston , Texas , on February 1 . This was the last season until the 2016 NFL season where neither of the previous Super Bowl participants made the playoffs . The 2004 NFL season was the 85th regular season of the National Football League . With the New England Patriots as the defending league champions , regular season play was held from September 9 , 2004 to January 2 , 2005 . Hurricanes forced the rescheduling of two Miami Dolphins home games : the game against the Tennessee Titans was moved up one day to Saturday , September 11 to avoid oncoming Hurricane Ivan , while the game versus the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday , September 26 was moved back 7\u00bd hours to miss the eye of Hurricane Jeanne . The playoffs began on January 8 , and eventually New England repeated as NFL champions when they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX , the Super Bowl championship game , at ALLTEL Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida on February 6 .",

        "table_passage_row_old": "Franklin Delano Frank Gore ( born May 14 , 1983 ) is an American professional football player who is a running back for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He played college football for the University of Miami , and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft , playing with them from 2005 to 2014 . He is the 49ers all-time leader in rushing yards . In his NFL career , Gore has had nine 1,000-rushing-yard seasons and five Pro Bowl selections . While achieving some personal success , he struggled with a team that suffered numerous losing seasons until he and the 49ers achieved a 13-3 record in the 2011 season under new head coach Jim Harbaugh . That season , the 49ers won the NFC West division and reached the NFC championship game , where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions , the New York Giants . In 2012 , Gore helped lead the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII , although they would lose to the Baltimore Ravens . In 2011 , Gore became the 49ers career rushing yards leader , and in 2012 he became the 49ers rushing touchdowns leader . In 2014 , Gore became the 29th player to have rushed for over 10,000 yards . He also spent three seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and one season with his hometown team , the Miami Dolphins . He is currently the oldest active running back in the league . In 2019 , he became the fourth player to have rushed for over 15,000 yards .The San Francisco 49ers are a professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area . They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member of the league 's National Football Conference ( NFC ) West division . The team currently plays its home games at Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara , California , located 38 miles ( 61 km ) southeast of San Francisco in the heart of Silicon Valley . Since 1988 , the 49ers have been headquartered in Santa Clara . The team was founded in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference ( AAFC ) and joined the NFL in 1949 when the leagues merged . The 49ers were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco . The name 49ers comes from the prospectors who arrived in Northern California in the 1849 Gold Rush . The team is legally and corporately registered as San Francisco Forty Niners . The team began play at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco before moving across town to Candlestick Park in 1970 and then to Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara in 2014 . The 49ers won five Super Bowl championships between 1981 and 1994 , led by Hall of Famers Joe Montana , Jerry Rice , Ronnie Lott , Steve Young , and coaches Bill Walsh and George Seifert . They have been division champions 20 times between 1970 and 2019 , making them one of the most successful teams in NFL history . The 49ers have been in the league playoffs 27 times : 26 times in the NFL and one time in the AAFC . The 2005 NFL season was the 86th regular season of the National Football League . Regular season play was held from September 8 , 2005 to January 1 , 2006 . The regular season also saw the first ever regular season game played outside the United States , as well as the New Orleans Saints being forced to play elsewhere due to damage to the Superdome and the entire New Orleans area by Hurricane Katrina . The playoffs began on January 7 .

        "table_passage_row_old": "Curtis James Martin Jr. ( born May 1 , 1973 ) is a former American football running back who spent the majority of his career with the New York Jets of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Martin began his professional career with the New England Patriots , who selected him in the third round of the 1995 NFL Draft . As a free agent in 1998 , he joined the Jets where he finished his career in 2007 due to a career-ending knee injury in the 2006 NFL season . He retired as the fourth leading rusher in NFL history . He was selected as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012 .The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area . The Patriots compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough , Massachusetts , which is located 28 miles ( 45 km ) southwest of Boston , Massachusetts . The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium . Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) , the team joined the NFL in the leagues ' 1970 merger , then changed its name when it moved to Foxborough in 1971 . The New England Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium through 2001 , then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the 2002 season . The Patriots ' rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL . Since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000 , the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history , claiming 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001 . The franchise has since set numerous notable records , including most wins in a ten-year period ( 126 , in 2003-2012 ) , an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007 , the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history ( a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004 ) , and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history ( eleven straight division titles from 2009 to 2019 ) . The team owns the record for most Super Bowl appearances ( nine ) and wins ( six ) by a head coach-quarterback tandem , most conference championships overall ( eleven ) , most Super Bowl appearances overall ( eleven ) . The Patriots are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins ( six ) , and with the Denver Broncos for the most Super Bowl losses ( five ) . The 1995 NFL season was the 76th regular season of the National Football League . The league expanded to 30 teams with the addition of the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars . The two expansion teams were slotted into the two remaining divisions that previously had only four teams ( while the other four had five teams ) : the AFC Central ( Jaguars ) and the NFC West ( Panthers ) . Meanwhile , the two teams in Los Angeles relocated to other cities : the Rams transferred to St. Louis ( but would return to Los Angeles in 2016 ) and the Raiders moved back to Oakland ; this would be the start of a 20-year absence for the NFL in Los Angeles . During the course of the season it emerged that the Cleveland Browns would relocate to Baltimore for the 1996 season . The Raiders move was not announced until after the schedule had been announced , which resulted in a problem in the third week of the season when both the Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers had games scheduled to air on NBC which ended up overlapping each other . The Raiders game was rescheduled for 10:00 AM PDT in case they were to relocate and NBC was given the doubleheader so that both Bay Area teams had their games televised locally . The season ended with Super Bowl XXX , when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium . They became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years . This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shulas last season as coach . The 1997 NFL season was the 78th regular season of the National Football League . The Oilers relocated from Houston , Texas to Nashville , Tennessee . The newly renamed Tennessee Oilers played their home games during this season at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee while construction of a new stadium in Nashville started . Houston would rejoin the NFL with the expansion Texans in 2002 . This was the last season to date that TNT broadcast NFL games , as well as the last for NBC until 2006 . When the TV contracts were renewed near the end of the season , Fox retained the National Football Conference package , CBS took over the American Football Conference package and ESPN won the right to televise all of the Sunday night games . Due to Game 7 of the 1997 World Series , the Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at Pro Player Stadium was delayed one day to Monday , October 27 . The Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers both changed their uniforms , and the new uniforms for both teams were introduced during this season . The season ended with Super Bowl XXXII when the Denver Broncos defeated the Green Bay Packers 31-24 at Qualcomm Stadium . This broke the National Football Conference 's streak of thirteen consecutive Super Bowl victories , the last American Football Conference win having been the Los Angeles Raiders defeating the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII . The New York Jets are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area . They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team is headquartered in Florham Park , New Jersey . In a unique arrangement for the league , the Jets share MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey with the New York Giants . The franchise is legally and corporately registered as New York Jets , LLC . The team was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) ; later , the franchise joined the NFL in the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 . The team began play in 1960 at the Polo Grounds . Under new ownership , the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in 1964 and then to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1984 . The Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated the Baltimore Colts , becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game . Since 1968 , the Jets have appeared in the playoffs 13 times , and in the AFC Championship Game four times , most recently losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010 . However , the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl , making them one of three NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance , along with the New Orleans Saints and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Apart from the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions , who have never reached the Super Bowl ( although both won NFL championships prior to 1966 ) , the Jets ' drought is the longest among current NFL franchises . The 1998 NFL season was the 79th regular season of the National Football League . The season culminated with Super Bowl XXXIII , with the Denver Broncos defeating the Atlanta Falcons 34-19 at Pro Player Stadium . The Broncos had won their first thirteen games , the best start since the undefeated 1972 Dolphins , and were tipped by some to have a realistic chance at winning all nineteen games . The Minnesota Vikings became the first team since the 1968 Baltimore Colts to win all but one of their regular season games and not win the Super Bowl . After no team had won 14 regular season games since the 1992 49ers , three teams went 14-2 or better for the only time in a 16-game season . Football Outsiders noted : The 2005 NFL season was the 86th regular season of the National Football League . Regular season play was held from September 8 , 2005 to January 1 , 2006 . The regular season also saw the first ever regular season game played outside the United States , as well as the New Orleans Saints being forced to play elsewhere due to damage to the Superdome and the entire New Orleans area by Hurricane Katrina . The playoffs began on January 7 . New England 's streak of 10 consecutive playoff wins and chance at a third straight Super Bowl title was ended in the Divisional Playoff Round by the Denver Broncos , and eventually the NFL title was won by the Pittsburgh Steelers , who defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10 in Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit , Michigan on February 5 for their fifth Super Bowl win . This also marked the first time that a sixth-seeded team , who by the nature of their seeding would play every game on the road , would advance to and win the Super Bowl . The season formally concluded with the Pro Bowl , the league 's all-star game , at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu , Hawaii on February 12 .",

The Broncos had won their first thirteen games , the best start since the undefeated 1972 Dolphins , and were tipped by some to have a realistic chance at winning all nineteen games . The Minnesota Vikings became the first team since the 1968 Baltimore Colts to win all but one of their regular season games and not win the Super Bowl . After no team had won 14 regular season games since the 1992 49ers , three teams went 14-2 or better for the only time in a 16-game season . Football Outsiders noted : The New York Jets are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area . They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team is headquartered in Florham Park , New Jersey . In a unique arrangement for the league , the Jets share MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey with the New York Giants . The franchise is legally and corporately registered as New York Jets , LLC . The team was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) ; later , the franchise joined the NFL in the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 . The team began play in 1960 at the Polo Grounds . Under new ownership , the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in 1964 and then to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1984 . The Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated the Baltimore Colts , becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game . Since 1968 , the Jets have appeared in the playoffs 13 times , and in the AFC Championship Game four times , most recently losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010 . However , the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl , making them one of three NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance , along with the New Orleans Saints and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Apart from the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions , who have never reached the Super Bowl ( although both won NFL championships prior to 1966 ) , the Jets ' drought is the longest among current NFL franchises . The 1995 NFL season was the 76th regular season of the National Football League . The league expanded to 30 teams with the addition of the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars . The two expansion teams were slotted into the two remaining divisions that previously had only four teams ( while the other four had five teams ) : the AFC Central ( Jaguars ) and the NFC West ( Panthers ) . Meanwhile , the two teams in Los Angeles relocated to other cities : the Rams transferred to St. Louis ( but would return to Los Angeles in 2016 ) and the Raiders moved back to Oakland ; this would be the start of a 20-year absence for the NFL in Los Angeles . During the course of the season it emerged that the Cleveland Browns would relocate to Baltimore for the 1996 season . The Raiders move was not announced until after the schedule had been announced , which resulted in a problem in the third week of the season when both the Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers had games scheduled to air on NBC which ended up overlapping each other . The Raiders game was rescheduled for 10:00 AM PDT in case they were to relocate and NBC was given the doubleheader so that both Bay Area teams had their games televised locally . The season ended with Super Bowl XXX , when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium . They became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years . This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shulas last season as coach . The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area . The Patriots compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough , Massachusetts , which is located 28 miles ( 45 km ) southwest of Boston , Massachusetts . The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium . Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) , the team joined the NFL in the leagues ' 1970 merger , then changed its name when it moved to Foxborough in 1971 . The New England Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium through 2001 , then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the 2002 season . The Patriots ' rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL . Since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000 , the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history , claiming 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001 . The franchise has since set numerous notable records , including most wins in a ten-year period ( 126 , in 2003-2012 ) , an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007 , the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history ( a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004 ) , and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history ( eleven straight division titles from 2009 to 2019 ) . The team owns the record for most Super Bowl appearances ( nine ) and wins ( six ) by a head coach-quarterback tandem , most conference championships overall ( eleven ) , most Super Bowl appearances overall ( eleven ) . The Patriots are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins ( six ) , and with the Denver Broncos for the most Super Bowl losses ( five ) . The 2005 NFL season was the 86th regular season of the National Football League . Regular season play was held from September 8 , 2005 to January 1 , 2006 . The regular season also saw the first ever regular season game played outside the United States , as well as the New Orleans Saints being forced to play elsewhere due to damage to the Superdome and the entire New Orleans area by Hurricane Katrina . The playoffs began on January 7 . New England 's streak of 10 consecutive playoff wins and chance at a third straight Super Bowl title was ended in the Divisional Playoff Round by the Denver Broncos , and eventually the NFL title was won by the Pittsburgh Steelers , who defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10 in Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit , Michigan on February 5 for their fifth Super Bowl win . This also marked the first time that a sixth-seeded team , who by the nature of their seeding would play every game on the road , would advance to and win the Super Bowl . The season formally concluded with the Pro Bowl , the league 's all-star game , at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu , Hawaii on February 12 . The 1997 NFL season was the 78th regular season of the National Football League . The Oilers relocated from Houston , Texas to Nashville , Tennessee . The newly renamed Tennessee Oilers played their home games during this season at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee while construction of a new stadium in Nashville started . Houston would rejoin the NFL with the expansion Texans in 2002 . This was the last season to date that TNT broadcast NFL games , as well as the last for NBC until 2006 . When the TV contracts were renewed near the end of the season , Fox retained the National Football Conference package , CBS took over the American Football Conference package and ESPN won the right to televise all of the Sunday night games . Due to Game 7 of the 1997 World Series , the Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at Pro Player Stadium was delayed one day to Monday , October 27 . The Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers both changed their uniforms , and the new uniforms for both teams were introduced during this season . The season ended with Super Bowl XXXII when the Denver Broncos defeated the Green Bay Packers 31-24 at Qualcomm Stadium . This broke the National Football Conference 's streak of thirteen consecutive Super Bowl victories , the last American Football Conference win having been the Los Angeles Raiders defeating the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII ."

        "table_passage_row_old": "Jerome Abram Bettis Sr. ( born February 16 , 1972 ) , nicknamed The Bus , is a former American football halfback who played for the Los Angeles Rams/St . Louis Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Bettis is seventh on the list of NFL rushing yards leaders . He retired in 2006 after he won Super Bowl XL with the Steelers in his native Detroit , Michigan , beating the Seattle Seahawks . Bettis was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015 .The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Greater Los Angeles area . The Rams compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) West division . The club has won three NFL championships , and is the only one to win championships representing three cities ( Cleveland in 1945 , Los Angeles in 1951 , and St. Louis in 1999 ) . Starting in 2020 , the Rams will play their home games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood , which they will share with the Los Angeles Chargers . The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams , based in Cleveland , Ohio . The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured players such as William Bud Cooper , Harry The Horse Mattos , Stan Pincura , and Mike Sebastian . Damon Buzz Wetzel joined as general manager . The franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1946 following the 1945 NFL Championship Game victory , making way for Paul Brown 's Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference and becoming the only NFL championship team to play the following season in another city . The club played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving into a reconstructed Anaheim Stadium in Orange County , California in 1980 . The Rams left California and moved to St. Louis , Missouri , following the 1994 NFL season . Five seasons after relocating , the team won Super Bowl XXXIV in a 23-16 victory over the Tennessee Titans . They then appeared in Super Bowl XXXVI , where they lost 20-17 to the New England Patriots . The 1993 NFL season was the 74th regular season of the National Football League . It was the only season in league history where all NFL teams were scheduled to play their 16-game schedule over a span of 18 weeks ( the league again played 16 games over 18 weeks in 2001 , but this was not planned and instead was caused by the postponement of a week of games due to the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ) . After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in 1990 , the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue . This was also done to avoid scheduling playoff games on January 1 and competing with college football bowl games . However , teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines , and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended . On March 1 , 1993 , the current free agent system was introduced to the league . When new TV contracts were signed in December 1993 , CBS lost their rights to broadcasting NFC games to the then seven-year old Fox Network ( which had just started up its own sports division ) , which took effect next season ; this ended a 37 year association with the NFL for CBS . The season ended with Super Bowl XXVIII when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 30-13 for the second consecutive season at the Georgia Dome . This remains the only time both Super Bowl participants have been the same in successive seasons . The Cowboys became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing their first two regular season games . This game also marked the fourth consecutive Super Bowl loss by the Bills , who remain the only team to reach four straight Super Bowls . The 1995 NFL season was the 76th regular season of the National Football League . The league expanded to 30 teams with the addition of the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars . The two expansion teams were slotted into the two remaining divisions that previously had only four teams ( while the other four had five teams ) : the AFC Central ( Jaguars ) and the NFC West ( Panthers ) . Meanwhile , the two teams in Los Angeles relocated to other cities : the Rams transferred to St. Louis ( but would return to Los Angeles in 2016 ) and the Raiders moved back to Oakland ; this would be the start of a 20-year absence for the NFL in Los Angeles . During the course of the season it emerged that the Cleveland Browns would relocate to Baltimore for the 1996 season . The Raiders move was not announced until after the schedule had been announced , which resulted in a problem in the third week of the season when both the Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers had games scheduled to air on NBC which ended up overlapping each other . The Raiders game was rescheduled for 10:00 AM PDT in case they were to relocate and NBC was given the doubleheader so that both Bay Area teams had their games televised locally . The season ended with Super Bowl XXX , when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium . They became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years . This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shulas last season as coach . The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL , and they are the oldest franchise in the AFC . In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL , where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship , the Steelers of the post-merger ( modern ) era are among the most successful NFL franchises . The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six , and they have both played in ( 16 times ) and hosted ( 11 times ) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL . The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots ' record 11 AFC championships .

Louis Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Bettis is seventh on the list of NFL rushing yards leaders . He retired in 2006 after he won Super Bowl XL with the Steelers in his native Detroit , Michigan , beating the Seattle Seahawks . Bettis was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015 . The 1996 NFL season was the 77th regular season of the National Football League and the season was marked by notable controversies from beginning to end . The season ended with Super Bowl XXXI when the Green Bay Packers defeated the New England Patriots 35-21 at the Louisiana Superdome . The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Founded in 1933 , the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL , and they are the oldest franchise in the AFC . In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL , where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship , the Steelers of the post-merger ( modern ) era are among the most successful NFL franchises . The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six , and they have both played in ( 16 times ) and hosted ( 11 times ) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL . The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships , tied with the Denver Broncos , but behind the Patriots ' record 11 AFC championships . The team is tied with the Broncos and Dallas Cowboys for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight . They lost their most recent championship appearance , Super Bowl XLV , on February 6 , 2011 . The Steelers , whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s , joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8 , 1933 .

To distinguish them from the baseball team , local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen , an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname . The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization 's founding . The 1995 NFL season was the 76th regular season of the National Football League . The league expanded to 30 teams with the addition of the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars . The two expansion teams were slotted into the two remaining divisions that previously had only four teams ( while the other four had five teams ) : the AFC Central ( Jaguars ) and the NFC West ( Panthers ) . Meanwhile , the two teams in Los Angeles relocated to other cities : the Rams transferred to St. Louis ( but would return to Los Angeles in 2016 ) and the Raiders moved back to Oakland ; this would be the start of a 20-year absence for the NFL in Los Angeles . During the course of the season it emerged that the Cleveland Browns would relocate to Baltimore for the 1996 season . The Raiders move was not announced until after the schedule had been announced , which resulted in a problem in the third week of the season when both the Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers had games scheduled to air on NBC which ended up overlapping each other . The Raiders game was rescheduled for 10:00 AM PDT in case they were to relocate and NBC was given the doubleheader so that both Bay Area teams had their games televised locally . The season ended with Super Bowl XXX , when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium . They became the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years . This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shulas last season as coach . The 1993 NFL season was the 74th regular season of the National Football League . It was the only season in league history where all NFL teams were scheduled to play their 16-game schedule over a span of 18 weeks ( the league again played 16 games over 18 weeks in 2001 , but this was not planned and instead was caused by the postponement of a week of games due to the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ) . After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in 1990 , the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue . This was also done to avoid scheduling playoff games on January 1 and competing with college football bowl games . However , teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines , and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended . On March 1 , 1993 , the current free agent system was introduced to the league . When new TV contracts were signed in December 1993 , CBS lost their rights to broadcasting NFC games to the then seven-year old Fox Network ( which had just started up its own sports division ) , which took effect next season ; this ended a 37 year association with the NFL for CBS . The season ended with Super Bowl XXVIII when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 30-13 for the second consecutive season at the Georgia Dome . This remains the only time both Super Bowl participants have been the same in successive seasons . The Cowboys became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing their first two regular season games . This game also marked the fourth consecutive Super Bowl loss by the Bills , who remain the only team to reach four straight Super Bowls . The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Greater Los Angeles area . The Rams compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) West division . The club has won three NFL championships , and is the only one to win championships representing three cities ( Cleveland in 1945 , Los Angeles in 1951 , and St. Louis in 1999 ) . Starting in 2020 , the Rams will play their home games at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood , which they will share with the Los Angeles Chargers . The franchise began in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams , based in Cleveland , Ohio . The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured players such as William Bud Cooper , Harry The Horse Mattos , Stan Pincura , and Mike Sebastian . Damon Buzz Wetzel joined as general manager . The franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1946 following the 1945 NFL Championship Game victory , making way for Paul Brown 's Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference and becoming the only NFL championship team to play the following season in another city . The club played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving into a reconstructed Anaheim Stadium in Orange County , California in 1980 . The Rams left California and moved to St. Louis , Missouri , following the 1994 NFL season . Five seasons after relocating , the team won Super Bowl XXXIV in a 23-16 victory over the Tennessee Titans . They then appeared in Super Bowl XXXVI , where they lost 20-17 to the New England Patriots . The 2005 NFL season was the 86th regular season of the National Football League .

The Cowboys ' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games ( home and away ) began in 2002 . The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times , tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos for second most Super Bowl appearances in history , just behind the New England Patriots record eleven Super Bowl appearances . This has also corresponded to eight NFC championships , most in the NFC . The Cowboys have won five of those Super Bowl appearances , tying them with their NFC rivals , the San Francisco 49ers ; both are second to Pittsburgh 's and New England 's record six Super Bowl championships . The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons ( 1966-85 ) , in which they missed the playoffs only twice ( 1974 and 1984 ) .

Prior to that , they played at Mile High Stadium from 1960 to 2000 . The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL . They did not have a winning season until 1973 . In 1977 , four years later , they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to Super Bowl XII . Since 1975 , the Broncos have become one of the NFL 's most successful teams , having suffered only seven losing seasons . They have won eight AFC Championships ( 1977 , 1986 , 1987 , 1989 , 1997 , 1998 , 2013 , 2015 ) , and three Super Bowl championships ( 1997 ( XXXII ) , 1998 ( XXXIII ) , 2015 ( 50 ) ) , and share the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses ( 5 - tied with the New England Patriots ) .

        "table_passage_row_old": "Marshall William Faulk ( born February 26 , 1973 ) is a former American football player who was a running back in the National Football League ( NFL ) for twelve seasons . He played college football for San Diego State University , and was a two-time consensus All-American . He was selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the second overall pick in the 1994 NFL Draft , and he also played professionally for the NFL 's St. Louis Rams . Faulk was a member of the Greatest Show on Turf , a name given to the St. Louis Rams team that appeared in two Super Bowls and won Super Bowl XXXIV . In 2000 , Faulk was named the Most Valuable Player of the NFL . Faulk is one of only three NFL players ( Marcus Allen and Tiki Barber being the others ) to reach at least 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards ; he is the only one to amass 12,000 yards rushing and 6,000 yards receiving . Faulk was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2017 . He was an analyst for various programs on the NFL Network until December 2017 .The Indianapolis Colts are an American football team based in Indianapolis , Indiana . The Colts compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) South division . Since the 2008 season , the Colts have played their games in Lucas Oil Stadium . Previously , the team had played for over two decades ( 1984-2007 ) at the RCA Dome . Since 1987 , the Colts have been the host team for the NFL Scouting Combine . The Colts have been a member club of the NFL since their founding in Baltimore in 1953 . They were one of three NFL teams to join those of the American Football League ( AFL ) to form the AFC following the 1970 merger . While in Baltimore , the team advanced to the playoffs 10 times and won three NFL Championship games in 1958 , 1959 , and 1968 . The Colts played in two Super Bowls while they were based in Baltimore , losing to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III and defeating the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. The Colts relocated to Indianapolis in 1984 and have since appeared in the playoffs 16 times , won two conference championships , and won one Super Bowl , in which they defeated the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI . The 1994 NFL season was the 75th regular season of the National Football League . To honor the NFL 's 75th season , a special anniversary logo was designed and each player wore a patch on their jerseys with this logo throughout the season . Also , a selection committee of media and league personnel named a special NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team , honoring the best NFL players from the first 75 seasons . The Phoenix Cardinals changed their name to Arizona Cardinals in an attempt to widen their appeal to the entire state of Arizona instead of just the Phoenix area . The name was initially resisted by Bill Bidwill . The Seattle Seahawks played their first three regular season home games at Husky Stadium because the Kingdome , the Seahawks ' regular home field , was undergoing repairs for damaged tiles on its roof . The Seahawks returned for the 2000 and 2001 seasons while their new stadium was under construction . This marked the last season until 2016 that the city of Los Angeles had an NFL team and the last one until 2017 that the city had two . Both the Rams and the Raiders left the city following the season . The Rams moved east to St. Louis , Missouri after being in Los Angeles for 49 years , while the Raiders left after twelve seasons to return to their previous home in Oakland , California . The Rams eventually returned in 2016 after failing to reach an agreement with St. Louis on a new stadium . This was also the first season that the then eight-year old Fox network televised NFL games ; the network had started its own sports division a year prior . The 1998 NFL season was the 79th regular season of the National Football League . The season culminated with Super Bowl XXXIII , with the Denver Broncos defeating the Atlanta Falcons 34-19 at Pro Player Stadium . The Broncos had won their first thirteen games , the best start since the undefeated 1972 Dolphins , and were tipped by some to have a realistic chance at winning all nineteen games . The Minnesota Vikings became the first team since the 1968 Baltimore Colts to win all but one of their regular season games and not win the Super Bowl . After no team had won 14 regular season games since the 1992 49ers , three teams went 14-2 or better for the only time in a 16-game season . Football Outsiders noted : In 1995 , the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League relocated the franchise from southern California to the Midwestern United States , moving to St. Louis , Missouri and becoming known as the St. Louis Rams . The Rams called St. Louis home from 1995 until the end of the 2015 season , after which they returned to playing in their former home in Los Angeles . The Rams ' relocation to St. Louis gave the city a professional football team for the first time since the end of the 1987 season . That was the last year that the now-Arizona Cardinals played there before moving to Tempe in 1988 . The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history ; the team previously called Cleveland , Ohio home until 1946 . The Rams played their home games at what is now known as The Dome at America 's Center in downtown St. Louis , which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team . The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers . The Rams ' last game played in St. Louis , in what was by then known as the Edward Jones Dome , was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17 , 2015 , which they won , 31-23 . The Rams last game as a St. Louis-based franchise was on January 3 , 2016 , against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi 's Stadium , when they lost in overtime 19-16 . The 1999 NFL season was the 80th regular season of the National Football League . The Cleveland Browns returned to the field for the first time since the 1995 season , while the Tennessee Oilers changed their name to Tennessee Titans , with the league retiring the name Oilers . The return of the Browns increased the number of teams to 31 , the first time the league had played with an odd number of teams since 1966 . This required the NFL to give at least one team a bye each week ; previously , barring extreme circumstances , a club never received a bye during the first two weeks or last seven weeks of the season . Under a new system , for ten weeks of the season ( Week # 1 , Week # 2 and Week # 10 to Week # 17 ) , one team received a bye , and for seven weeks of the season ( Week # 3 to Week # 9 ) , three teams received a bye . This format would continue until the Houston Texans joined the NFL in 2002 , returning the league to an even number of teams . The start of the 1999 NFL Season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day , a change from the previous seasons : due to the Y2K concerns , the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday January 1 , 2000 , and did not want teams traveling on that day . This was also done to avoid competing against college football 's New Years Day bowl games . Week 17 games were held on January 2 , 2000 , and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8 and 9 , with the bye week before the Super Bowl removed to accommodate the one-week adjustment . The start of the season after Labor Day would become a regular fixture for future seasons , beginning in 2001 . The final spot in the NFC playoffs came down to an exciting final day of the season . The Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers were both at 7-8 , tied for the last spot in the playoffs with the Dallas Cowboys and tied in other tiebreakers . The 2005 NFL season was the 86th regular season of the National Football League . Regular season play was held from September 8 , 2005 to January 1 , 2006 . The regular season also saw the first ever regular season game played outside the United States , as well as the New Orleans Saints being forced to play elsewhere due to damage to the Superdome and the entire New Orleans area by Hurricane Katrina . The playoffs began on January 7 . New England 's streak of 10 consecutive playoff wins and chance at a third straight Super Bowl title was ended in the Divisional Playoff Round by the Denver Broncos , and eventually the NFL title was won by the Pittsburgh Steelers , who defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10 in Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit , Michigan on February 5 for their fifth Super Bowl win . This also marked the first time that a sixth-seeded team , who by the nature of their seeding would play every game on the road , would advance to and win the Super Bowl . The season formally concluded with the Pro Bowl , the league 's all-star game , at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu , Hawaii on February 12 .",

After no team had won 14 regular season games since the 1992 49ers , three teams went 14-2 or better for the only time in a 16-game season . Football Outsiders noted : The Indianapolis Colts are an American football team based in Indianapolis , Indiana . The Colts compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) South division . Since the 2008 season , the Colts have played their games in Lucas Oil Stadium . Previously , the team had played for over two decades ( 1984-2007 ) at the RCA Dome . Since 1987 , the Colts have been the host team for the NFL Scouting Combine . The Colts have been a member club of the NFL since their founding in Baltimore in 1953 . They were one of three NFL teams to join those of the American Football League ( AFL ) to form the AFC following the 1970 merger . While in Baltimore , the team advanced to the playoffs 10 times and won three NFL Championship games in 1958 , 1959 , and 1968 . The Colts played in two Super Bowls while they were based in Baltimore , losing to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III and defeating the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. The Colts relocated to Indianapolis in 1984 and have since appeared in the playoffs 16 times , won two conference championships , and won one Super Bowl , in which they defeated the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI . The 1994 NFL season was the 75th regular season of the National Football League . To honor the NFL 's 75th season , a special anniversary logo was designed and each player wore a patch on their jerseys with this logo throughout the season . Also , a selection committee of media and league personnel named a special NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team , honoring the best NFL players from the first 75 seasons . The Phoenix Cardinals changed their name to Arizona Cardinals in an attempt to widen their appeal to the entire state of Arizona instead of just the Phoenix area . The name was initially resisted by Bill Bidwill . The Seattle Seahawks played their first three regular season home games at Husky Stadium because the Kingdome , the Seahawks ' regular home field , was undergoing repairs for damaged tiles on its roof . The Seahawks returned for the 2000 and 2001 seasons while their new stadium was under construction . This marked the last season until 2016 that the city of Los Angeles had an NFL team and the last one until 2017 that the city had two . Both the Rams and the Raiders left the city following the season . The Rams moved east to St. Louis , Missouri after being in Los Angeles for 49 years , while the Raiders left after twelve seasons to return to their previous home in Oakland , California . The Rams eventually returned in 2016 after failing to reach an agreement with St. Louis on a new stadium . This was also the first season that the then eight-year old Fox network televised NFL games ; the network had started its own sports division a year prior . The 2005 NFL season was the 86th regular season of the National Football League . Regular season play was held from September 8 , 2005 to January 1 , 2006 . The regular season also saw the first ever regular season game played outside the United States , as well as the New Orleans Saints being forced to play elsewhere due to damage to the Superdome and the entire New Orleans area by Hurricane Katrina . The playoffs began on January 7 . New England 's streak of 10 consecutive playoff wins and chance at a third straight Super Bowl title was ended in the Divisional Playoff Round by the Denver Broncos , and eventually the NFL title was won by the Pittsburgh Steelers , who defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10 in Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit , Michigan on February 5 for their fifth Super Bowl win . This also marked the first time that a sixth-seeded team , who by the nature of their seeding would play every game on the road , would advance to and win the Super Bowl . The season formally concluded with the Pro Bowl , the league 's all-star game , at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu , Hawaii on February 12 . The 1999 NFL season was the 80th regular season of the National Football League . The Cleveland Browns returned to the field for the first time since the 1995 season , while the Tennessee Oilers changed their name to Tennessee Titans , with the league retiring the name Oilers . The return of the Browns increased the number of teams to 31 , the first time the league had played with an odd number of teams since 1966 . This required the NFL to give at least one team a bye each week ; previously , barring extreme circumstances , a club never received a bye during the first two weeks or last seven weeks of the season . Under a new system , for ten weeks of the season ( Week # 1 , Week # 2 and Week # 10 to Week # 17 ) , one team received a bye , and for seven weeks of the season ( Week # 3 to Week # 9 ) , three teams received a bye . This format would continue until the Houston Texans joined the NFL in 2002 , returning the league to an even number of teams . The start of the 1999 NFL Season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day , a change from the previous seasons : due to the Y2K concerns , the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday January 1 , 2000 , and did not want teams traveling on that day . This was also done to avoid competing against college football 's New Years Day bowl games . Week 17 games were held on January 2 , 2000 , and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8 and 9 , with the bye week before the Super Bowl removed to accommodate the one-week adjustment . The start of the season after Labor Day would become a regular fixture for future seasons , beginning in 2001 . The final spot in the NFC playoffs came down to an exciting final day of the season . The Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers were both at 7-8 , tied for the last spot in the playoffs with the Dallas Cowboys and tied in other tiebreakers . In 1995 , the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League relocated the franchise from southern California to the Midwestern United States , moving to St. Louis , Missouri and becoming known as the St. Louis Rams . The Rams called St. Louis home from 1995 until the end of the 2015 season , after which they returned to playing in their former home in Los Angeles . The Rams ' relocation to St. Louis gave the city a professional football team for the first time since the end of the 1987 season . That was the last year that the now-Arizona Cardinals played there before moving to Tempe in 1988 . The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history ; the team previously called Cleveland , Ohio home until 1946 . The Rams played their home games at what is now known as The Dome at America 's Center in downtown St. Louis , which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team . The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers . The Rams ' last game played in St. Louis , in what was by then known as the Edward Jones Dome , was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17 , 2015 , which they won , 31-23 . The Rams last game as a St. Louis-based franchise was on January 3 , 2016 , against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi 's Stadium , when they lost in overtime 19-16 ."

The Arizona Cardinals are a professional American football franchise based in Phoenix , Arizona .

The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898 , and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United States . The Cardinals play their home games at State Farm Stadium , which opened in 2006 and is located in the northwestern suburb of Glendale . The team was established in Chicago in 1898 as an amateur football team and joined the NFL as a charter member on September 17 , 1920 . Along with the Chicago Bears , the club is one of two NFL charter member franchises still in operation since the league 's founding ( the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL a year after its creation in 1921 ) . The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city through 1987 ( sometimes referred to as the Football Cardinals or the Big Red to avoid confusion with the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball ) . Before the 1988 season , the team moved west to Tempe , Arizona , a college suburb east of Phoenix , and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University .

He scored 145 touchdowns , including a then-league-record 123 rushing touchdowns , and was elected to six Pro Bowls over the course of his career . Allen was the first NFL player to gain more than 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards during his career . Allen is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League ( NFL ) history . His younger brother , Damon Allen , played quarterback for 23 seasons in the Canadian Football League , was named to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2012 and was professional football 's all-time leader in passing yards . Allen has the distinction of being the only player to have won the Heisman Trophy , an NCAA national championship , the Super Bowl , and be named NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP . He has been inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame .The professional American football team now known as the Las Vegas Raiders played in Los Angeles , California as the Los Angeles Raiders from 1982 to 1994 before relocating back to Oakland where the team played from its inaugural 1960 season to the 1981 season . The Raiders franchise relocated from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982 . The Raiders first home game in Los Angeles was at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the San Diego Chargers on November 22 , 1982 after a 57 day player strike . Their last game as a Los Angeles-based club was played at the Coliseum against the Kansas City Chiefs on December 24 , 1994 , a game in which they lost 19-9 eliminating them from playoff competition . The 1982 NFL season was the 63rd regular season of the National Football League . A 57-day-long players ' strike reduced the 1982 season from a 16-game schedule per team to an abbreviated nine game schedule . Because of the shortened season , the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament ; division standings were ignored for seeding ( although each division sent at least one team to the playoffs and each division except the NFC West sent at least two teams ) . Eight teams from each conference were seeded 1-8 based on their regular season records . Two teams qualified for the playoffs despite losing records ( the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions ) . The season ended with Super Bowl XVII when the Washington Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27-17 at the Rose Bowl . Before the season , a verdict was handed down against the league in the trial brought by the Oakland Raiders and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum back in 1980 . The jury ruled that the NFL violated antitrust laws when it declined to approve the proposed move by the team from Oakland to Los Angeles . Thus , the league was forced to let the officially renamed Los Angeles Raiders play in the second largest city in the United States , returning football to the Los Angeles area proper following a two-year absence ( the Los Angeles Rams left the Coliseum for Anaheim Stadium in Orange County in 1980 ) . For the start of the 1982 season , the Minnesota Vikings moved from Metropolitan Stadium to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome . The 1992 NFL season was the 73rd regular season of the National Football League . Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew , the New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins game that was scheduled for September 6 at Joe Robbie Stadium was rescheduled to October 18 . Both teams originally had that weekend off . This marked the first time since the 1966 NFL season and the AFL seasons of 1966 and 1967 that there were byes in week 1 ; in those years , byes were necessary every week since there were an odd number of teams , which would happen again between 1999 and 2001 . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Dolphins also had their 2017 season opener postponed due to Hurricane Irma . The Atlanta Falcons played their first season in the new Georgia Dome , replacing Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , playing there until 2016 . The season ended with Super Bowl XXVII when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 52-17 at the Rose Bowl . This would be the third of the Bills four consecutive Super Bowl losses . Buffalo would join the Miami Dolphins of the early 1970s as the only team to reach three straight Super Bowls and not until the New England Patriots of the late 2010s would another team reach three in a row . The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City , Missouri . The Chiefs compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) West division . The team was founded in 1960 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter member of the American Football League ( AFL ) . ( It is not associated with the NFL Dallas Texans . ) In 1963 , the team moved to Kansas City and assumed its current name . The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the merger in 1970 . The team is valued at over $ 2 billion . Hunt 's son , Clark , serves as chairman and CEO . While Hunt 's ownership stakes passed collectively to his widow and children after his death in 2006 , Clark is the operating head of the franchise ; he represents the Chiefs at all league meetings and has ultimate authority on personnel changes . The Chiefs have won three AFL championships , in 1962 , 1966 , and 1969 . They became the second AFL team ( after the New York Jets ) to defeat an NFL team in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game , when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV . The team 's victory on January 11 , 1970 , was the final such competition before the leagues ' merger went into full effect . The 1993 NFL season was the 74th regular season of the National Football League . It was the only season in league history where all NFL teams were scheduled to play their 16-game schedule over a span of 18 weeks ( the league again played 16 games over 18 weeks in 2001 , but this was not planned and instead was caused by the postponement of a week of games due to the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ) . After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in 1990 , the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue . This was also done to avoid scheduling playoff games on January 1 and competing with college football bowl games . However , teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines , and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended . On March 1 , 1993 , the current free agent system was introduced to the league . When new TV contracts were signed in December 1993 , CBS lost their rights to broadcasting NFC games to the then seven-year old Fox Network ( which had just started up its own sports division ) , which took effect next season ; this ended a 37 year association with the NFL for CBS . The season ended with Super Bowl XXVIII when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 30-13 for the second consecutive season at the Georgia Dome . This remains the only time both Super Bowl participants have been the same in successive seasons . The Cowboys became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing their first two regular season games . This game also marked the fourth consecutive Super Bowl loss by the Bills , who remain the only team to reach four straight Super Bowls . The 1997 NFL season was the 78th regular season of the National Football League . The Oilers relocated from Houston , Texas to Nashville , Tennessee . The newly renamed Tennessee Oilers played their home games during this season at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee while construction of a new stadium in Nashville started . Houston would rejoin the NFL with the expansion Texans in 2002 . This was the last season to date that TNT broadcast NFL games , as well as the last for NBC until 2006 . When the TV contracts were renewed near the end of the season , Fox retained the National Football Conference package , CBS took over the American Football Conference package and ESPN won the right to televise all of the Sunday night games . Due to Game 7 of the 1997 World Series , the Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at Pro Player Stadium was delayed one day to Monday , October 27 . The Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers both changed their uniforms , and the new uniforms for both teams were introduced during this season . The season ended with Super Bowl XXXII when the Denver Broncos defeated the Green Bay Packers 31-24 at Qualcomm Stadium . This broke the National Football Conference 's streak of thirteen consecutive Super Bowl victories , the last American Football Conference win having been the Los Angeles Raiders defeating the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII .",

The Bills began play as an original franchise of the American Football League ( AFL ) in 1960 . The club joined the NFL as a result of the AFL-NFL merger for the 1970 season . The 1964 and 1965 Bills were the only teams representing Buffalo that won major league professional sports championships ( back-to-back American Football League Championships ) . The Bills are the only team to win four consecutive conference championships and are the only NFL team to lose four consecutive Super Bowl games . The team was owned by Ralph Wilson from the team 's founding in 1960 , until his death in 2014 at the age of 95 . After his death , Wilson 's estate reached an agreement to sell the team to Terry and Kim Pegula , which was approved by the other NFL team owners on October 8 , 2014 . The Bills formerly possessed the longest active playoff drought in any of the four major professional sports in North America : they did not qualify to play in the NFL playoffs from 1999 until 2017 and were the last NFL team ( and last team in the major North American professional sports leagues overall ) to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in the 21st century . The 1988 NFL season was the 69th regular season of the National Football League . The Cardinals relocated from St. Louis , Missouri to the Phoenix , Arizona area becoming the Phoenix Cardinals but remained in the NFC East division . The playoff races came down to the regular seasons final week , with the Seattle Seahawks winning the AFC West by one game , and the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers winning their respective divisions in a five-way tie , with the New Orleans Saints and New York Giants losing the NFC Wild Card berth to the Los Angeles Rams on tiebreakers .

The Cleveland Browns returned to the field for the first time since the 1995 season , while the Tennessee Oilers changed their name to Tennessee Titans , with the league retiring the name Oilers . The return of the Browns increased the number of teams to 31 , the first time the league had played with an odd number of teams since 1966 . This required the NFL to give at least one team a bye each week ; previously , barring extreme circumstances , a club never received a bye during the first two weeks or last seven weeks of the season . Under a new system , for ten weeks of the season ( Week # 1 , Week # 2 and Week # 10 to Week # 17 ) , one team received a bye , and for seven weeks of the season ( Week # 3 to Week # 9 ) , three teams received a bye . This format would continue until the Houston Texans joined the NFL in 2002 , returning the league to an even number of teams . The start of the 1999 NFL Season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day , a change from the previous seasons : due to the Y2K concerns , the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday January 1 , 2000 , and did not want teams traveling on that day . This was also done to avoid competing against college football 's New Years Day bowl games . Week 17 games were held on January 2 , 2000 , and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8 and 9 , with the bye week before the Super Bowl removed to accommodate the one-week adjustment . The start of the season after Labor Day would become a regular fixture for future seasons , beginning in 2001 . The final spot in the NFC playoffs came down to an exciting final day of the season . The Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers were both at 7-8 , tied for the last spot in the playoffs with the Dallas Cowboys and tied in other tiebreakers .

The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks , who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946 , before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts . For the first few years , the Dolphins ' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew 's School , a private boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton . In the 1970 AFL-NFL merger , the Dolphins joined the NFL . The team made its first Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl VI , losing to the Dallas Cowboys , 24-3 . The following year , the Dolphins completed the NFL 's only perfect season , culminating in a Super Bowl win , winning all 14 of their regular season games , and all three of their playoff games , including Super Bowl VII . The 2000 NFL season was the 81st regular season of the National Football League . The season ended with Super Bowl XXXV when the Baltimore Ravens defeated the New York Giants 34-7 at the Raymond James Stadium . Week 1 of the season reverted to Labor Day weekend in 2000 . It would be the last NFL season to date to start on Labor Day weekend . It would also be the last time until 2015 that CBS televised the late afternoon games in Week 1 .

        "table_passage_row_old": "Steven Rashad Jackson ( born July 22 , 1983 ) is a former American football running back . He played college football for Oregon State and was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the first round with the 24th overall selection in the 2004 NFL Draft . He also played for the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots . Jackson holds the Rams franchise record for most rushing yards , and is a member of the 10,000 yard rushing club .In 1995 , the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League relocated the franchise from southern California to the Midwestern United States , moving to St. Louis , Missouri and becoming known as the St. Louis Rams . The Rams called St. Louis home from 1995 until the end of the 2015 season , after which they returned to playing in their former home in Los Angeles . The Rams ' relocation to St. Louis gave the city a professional football team for the first time since the end of the 1987 season . That was the last year that the now-Arizona Cardinals played there before moving to Tempe in 1988 . The relocation was the second in Rams franchise history ; the team previously called Cleveland , Ohio home until 1946 . The Rams played their home games at what is now known as The Dome at America 's Center in downtown St. Louis , which the city had been constructing for the previous few years in the hopes of gaining an NFL team . The city was left out of the expansion that brought Charlotte and Jacksonville into the league for 1995 and another attempt to secure a franchise fell through when the ownership group controlling the New England Patriots was forced out of power by their stadium 's owner and operator . The Rams new stadium was not ready for them when they initially arrived in Missouri , so they were forced to temporarily share Busch Memorial Stadium with the St. Louis Cardinals . Their first game in St. Louis against the New Orleans Saints was played on September 10 , 1995 with the Rams winning 17-13 . The then- Trans World Dome opened on November 12 , 1995 with the home team scoring a 28-17 victory against the Carolina Panthers . The Rams ' last game played in St. Louis , in what was by then known as the Edward Jones Dome , was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17 , 2015 , which they won , 31-23 . The Rams last game as a St. Louis-based franchise was on January 3 , 2016 , against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi 's Stadium , when they lost in overtime 19-16 . The 2004 NFL season was the 85th regular season of the National Football League . With the New England Patriots as the defending league champions , regular season play was held from September 9 , 2004 to January 2 , 2005 .

        "table_passage_row_old": "Corey James Dillon ( born October 24 , 1974 ) is a former American football running back who played in the National Football League ( NFL ) for ten seasons , primarily with the Cincinnati Bengals . In addition , he was also a member of the New England Patriots . Dillon played college football at the University of Washington after attending Garden City Community College and Dixie State College and was selected by the Bengals in the second round of the 1997 NFL Draft . Despite the overall poor performance of his team , he emerged as a standout player , setting several franchise records and being named to three Pro Bowls during his seven years in Cincinnati . In his last three seasons , Dillon played for the Patriots , where he was named to a fourth Pro Bowl and contributed to New England 's victory in Super Bowl XXXIX over the Philadelphia Eagles . He retired with 11,241 rushing yards , which currently ranks 20th among rushing yards leaders in the NFL .The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football franchise based in Cincinnati , Ohio . The Bengals compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) North division . Their home stadium is Paul Brown Stadium , located in downtown Cincinnati . Their divisional opponents are the Baltimore Ravens , Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers . The Bengals were founded in 1966 as a member of the American Football League ( AFL ) by former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown , and began play in the 1968 season . Brown was the Bengals ' head coach from their inception to 1975 . After being dismissed as the Browns ' head coach by Art Modell ( who had purchased majority interest in the team in 1961 ) in January 1963 , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus . He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city , Hamilton County , and Major League Baseball 's Cincinnati Reds ( who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field ) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games . Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL , which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season , Brown agreed to join the AFL as its tenth and final franchise . The Bengals , like the other former AFL teams , were assigned to the AFC following the merger . Cincinnati was also selected because , like their neighbors the Reds , they could draw from several large neighboring cities ( Louisville and Lexington , Kentucky ; Columbus , Dayton , and Springfield , Ohio ) that are all no more than 110 miles ( 180 km ) away from downtown Cincinnati , along with Indianapolis , until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season . The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981 and 1988 , but lost Super Bowls XVI and XXIII to the San Francisco 49ers . The 1997 NFL season was the 78th regular season of the National Football League . The Oilers relocated from Houston , Texas to Nashville , Tennessee . The newly renamed Tennessee Oilers played their home games during this season at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee while construction of a new stadium in Nashville started . Houston would rejoin the NFL with the expansion Texans in 2002 . This was the last season to date that TNT broadcast NFL games , as well as the last for NBC until 2006 . When the TV contracts were renewed near the end of the season , Fox retained the National Football Conference package , CBS took over the American Football Conference package and ESPN won the right to televise all of the Sunday night games . Due to Game 7 of the 1997 World Series , the Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at Pro Player Stadium was delayed one day to Monday , October 27 . The Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers both changed their uniforms , and the new uniforms for both teams were introduced during this season . The season ended with Super Bowl XXXII when the Denver Broncos defeated the Green Bay Packers 31-24 at Qualcomm Stadium . This broke the National Football Conference 's streak of thirteen consecutive Super Bowl victories , the last American Football Conference win having been the Los Angeles Raiders defeating the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII . The 2003 NFL season was the 84th regular season of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Regular-season play was held from September 4 , 2003 , to December 28 , 2003 . Due to damage caused by the Cedar Fire , Qualcomm Stadium was used as an emergency shelter , and thus the Miami Dolphins-San Diego Chargers regular-season match on October 27 was instead played at Sun Devil Stadium , the home field of the Arizona Cardinals . The playoffs began on January 3 , 2004 . The NFL title was won by the New England Patriots when they defeated the Carolina Panthers , 32-29 , in Super Bowl XXXVIII at Reliant Stadium in Houston , Texas , on February 1 .

The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area . The Patriots compete in the National Football League ( NFL ) as a member club of the league 's American Football Conference ( AFC ) East division . The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough , Massachusetts , which is located 28 miles ( 45 km ) southwest of Boston , Massachusetts . The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium . Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots , an original member of the American Football League ( AFL ) , the team joined the NFL in the leagues ' 1970 merger , then changed its name when it moved to Foxborough in 1971 . The New England Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium through 2001 , then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the 2002 season . The Patriots ' rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL . Since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000 , the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history , claiming 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001 . The franchise has since set numerous notable records , including most wins in a ten-year period ( 126 , in 2003-2012 ) , an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007 , the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history ( a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004 ) , and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history ( eleven straight division titles from 2009 to 2019 ) . The team owns the record for most Super Bowl appearances ( nine ) and wins ( six ) by a head coach-quarterback tandem , most conference championships overall ( eleven ) , most Super Bowl appearances overall ( eleven ) . The Patriots are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins ( six ) , and with the Denver Broncos for the most Super Bowl losses ( five ) . The 2004 NFL season was the 85th regular season of the National Football League . With the New England Patriots as the defending league champions , regular season play was held from September 9 , 2004 to January 2 , 2005 . Hurricanes forced the rescheduling of two Miami Dolphins home games : the game against the Tennessee Titans was moved up one day to Saturday , September 11 to avoid oncoming Hurricane Ivan , while the game versus the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday , September 26 was moved back 7\u00bd hours to miss the eye of Hurricane Jeanne . The playoffs began on January 8 , and eventually New England repeated as NFL champions when they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX , the Super Bowl championship game , at ALLTEL Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida on February 6 . The 2006 NFL season was the 87th regular season of the National Football League . Regular season play was held from September 7 to December 31 , 2006 . The season began with the reigning Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers defeating the Miami Dolphins 28-17 in the NFL Kickoff Game . The NFL title was eventually won by the Indianapolis Colts , when they defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 in Super Bowl XLI at Dolphin Stadium at Miami Gardens , Florida on February 4 .",

        "table_passage_row": "The equestrian events at the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Games included dressage ( team and individual medals ) , eventing ( team and individual medals ) , and show jumping ( individual medals while team medals were not awarded ) . The competitions were held from August 10 to 14 , 1932 . Due to the Great Depression , and the fact that the Games were held in Los Angeles ( which was considerably difficult for the European nations to travel to ) , only 35 entries from 6 nations competed - which was to be the lowest participation of any Olympic Games . The individual jumping in equestrian at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was held on 14 August . The event was called the Prix des Nations at the time . The same scores were used for both the individual and team competitions . While individual medals were awarded , none of the teams managed to have three riders finish the course so team medals were not awarded .

Clarence von Rosen Jr. ( November 10 , 1903 - July 7 , 1933 ) was a Swedish horse rider who competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics . In 1932 he and his horse Sunnyside Maid won the bronze medal in the individual eventing . At the same Olympics he also won the bronze medal in the individual jumping competition with his horse Empire . In both events the Swedish team was not able to complete the competition with three riders , therefore he was unable to win team medals . He was the son of Clarence von Rosen ."

        "table_passage_row_old": "Jenson Alexander Lyons Button MBE ( born 19 January 1980 ) is a British racing driver and former Formula One driver . He won the 2009 Formula One World Championship , driving for Brawn GP . He currently competes in the Japanese Super GT Series driving a Honda NSX-GT for Team Kunimitsu , in which he won the title in 2018 . Button began karting at the age of eight and achieved early success , before progressing to car racing in the British Formula Ford Championship and the British Formula 3 Championship . He first drove in Formula One with Williams for the 2000 season . The following year he switched to Benetton , which in 2002 became Renault , and then for the 2003 season he moved to BAR . In 2004 he finished 3rd in the World Drivers ' Championship , with only the two Ferraris ahead of him . BAR was subsequently renamed Honda for the 2006 season , during which Button won his first Grand Prix in Hungary , after 113 races . Following the withdrawal of Honda from the sport in December 2008 , he was left without a drive for the 2009 season , until Ross Brawn led a management buyout of the team in February 2009 , and Button suddenly found himself in a highly competitive , Mercedes-engined car . He went on to win a record-tying six of the first seven races of the 2009 season , securing the World Drivers ' Championship at the Brazilian Grand Prix , having led on points all season ; his success also helped Brawn GP to secure the World Constructors ' Championship . For 2010 , he moved to McLaren , partnering fellow British racer and former World Champion Lewis Hamilton . After finishing fifth for the team in 2010 , Button finished the 2011 season as runner-up .British American Racing , abbreviated as BAR , was a Formula One constructor that competed in the sport from 1999 to 2005 . BAR began by acquiring Tyrrell , and used Supertec engines for their first year . Subsequently , they formed a partnership with Honda which lasted for the next six years . The team was named after British American Tobacco plc ( BAT ) , which owned and sponsored it in order to display its Lucky Strike and 555 brands . The headquarters were in Brackley , Northamptonshire , United Kingdom . In mid-November 2004 , Japanese automobile manufacturer Honda purchased 45% of the team , and in September 2005 , purchased the remaining 55% share to become the sole owner . Consequently , BAR Honda became Honda Racing F1 Team for the 2006 Formula One season . BAT continued as title sponsor with the Lucky Strike brand , but due to new tobacco advertising regulations worldwide , pulled its sponsorship from Formula One entirely at the end of the 2006 season . Honda ran the team for the 2006 , 2007 and 2008 seasons . During 2008 , the Honda RA109 was being developed for the following year while Honda attempted to sell the team . A management buy-out by team principal Ross Brawn and an engine supply deal with Mercedes-Benz resulted in a remarkable 2009 season in which Brawn GP team won the Constructors ' Championship with Jenson Button winning the Drivers ' Championship . Mercedes bought the team in November 2009 and as of January 2020 [ update ] , the team competes as Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team . Honda has participated in Formula One , as an entrant , constructor and engine supplier , for various periods since 1964 . Honda 's involvement in Formula One began with the 1964 season , and in 1965 they achieved their first victory at the Mexican Grand Prix . After further success with John Surtees , Honda withdrew at the end of the 1968 season due to difficulties selling road cars in the United States and Honda driver Jo Schlesser 's fatal accident . Honda returned in 1983 as an engine supplier , which started a very successful period for Honda . After winning races in 1984 and 1985 , Honda won the Constructors ' Championship every year between 1986 and 1991 with Williams and McLaren , and the Drivers ' Championship every year from 1987 to 1991 with Nelson Piquet , Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost . Honda withdrew at the end of 1992 after having achieved their targets . Honda returned again in 2000 , providing engines for British American Racing ( BAR ) . BAR-Honda finished second in the Constructors ' Championship in 2004 , and by the end of 2005 Honda had bought out the BAR team , which became the Honda team for 2006 . After a good 2006 season where Jenson Button won the Hungarian Grand Prix , Honda announced in December 2008 that they would be exiting Formula One with immediate effect due to the global financial crisis , following two difficult seasons in 2007 and 2008 . In May 2013 , Honda announced their intention to return to the sport in the 2015 season under a works agreement with McLaren to supply power units . The first iterations of the Honda engines proved to be uncompetitive , and Honda spent their first three years under the harsh scrutiny of the public eye as they developed their power unit . McLaren and Honda split after three years , Toro Rosso however , agreed to use Honda engines for the 2018 season as a works outfit .",

Montoya is , alongside Fernando Alonso , one of only two active drivers who have won two legs of the Triple Crown of Motorsport in its original definition .

It was founded by team owner Sir Frank Williams and automotive engineer Sir Patrick Head . It is still run by Williams . The team was formed in 1977 after Frank Williams 's two earlier unsuccessful F1 operations : Frank Williams Racing Cars ( 1969 to 1975 ) and Wolf-Williams Racing ( 1976 ) . All of Williams F1 chassis are called FW then a number , the FW being the initials of team owner , Frank Williams . The team 's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix , where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick N\u00e8ve . Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year , and Switzerland 's Clay Regazzoni won Williams 's first race at the 1979 British Grand Prix . At the 1997 British Grand Prix , Canadian Jacques Villeneuve scored the team 's 100th race victory , making Williams one of only four teams in Formula One , alongside Ferrari , fellow British team McLaren , and Mercedes to win 100 races . Williams won nine Constructors ' Championships between 1980 and 1997 . This stood as a record until Ferrari surpassed it in 2000 . Drivers for Williams have included Australia 's Alan Jones ; Finland 's Keke Rosberg ; Britain 's Nigel Mansell , Damon Hill and Jenson Button ; France 's Alain Prost ; Brazil 's Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna ; and Canada 's Jacques Villeneuve . Each of these drivers , with the exception of Senna and Button , have captured one Drivers ' title with the team . BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers ' Championship in 1950 . The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s ( often under Formula Two regulations ) , before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s . This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham , which resulted in the team 's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987 , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW . BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS , Arrows , Benetton and Ligier teams during this period , with various degrees of success . In 1988 , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines , which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge . Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989 , rendering the M12/13 obsolete . BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team , which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997 . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race d\u00e9but in the Williams FW22 in 2000 . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories , but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s . By 2005 , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated , and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright . The BMW Sauber project lasted from 2006 until 2009 , and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team .

In addition to this title , R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen also finished second overall in 2003 and 2005 , and third in 2008 , 2012 and 2018 . R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen has won 21 Grands Prix , making him the most successful Finnish driver in terms of Formula One race wins .

R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 's seasons at McLaren were plagued by severe unreliability from his cars , prompting a move to Ferrari in 2007 . This change saw him crowned Formula One World Drivers ' Champion that season , pipping both McLaren drivers-Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso-to the title by just one point . In 2008 he equalled the record for the greatest number of fastest laps in a season for the second time .

McLaren is best known as a Formula One constructor and also has a history of competing in American open wheel racing as both an entrant and a chassis constructor , and has won the Canadian-American Challenge Cup ( Can-Am ) sports car racing championship . The team is the second oldest active , and second most successful Formula One team after Ferrari , having won 182 races , 12 Drivers ' Championships and eight Constructors ' Championships . The team is a wholly owned subsidiary of the McLaren Group . Founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren , the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix , but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am , which they dominated from 1967 to 1971 . Further American triumph followed , with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972 and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976 . After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970 , Teddy Mayer took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors ' Championship in 1974 , with Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the Drivers ' Championship in 1974 and 1976 respectively . The year 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by Phillip Morris ' Marlboro cigarette brand . In 1981 , McLaren merged with Ron Dennis ' Project Four Racing ; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team . This began the team 's most successful era : with Porsche and Honda engines , Niki Lauda , Alain Prost , and Ayrton Senna took between them seven Drivers ' Championships and the team took six Constructors ' Championships . The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant - together they won all but one race in 1988 - but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari .

Despite a point in their first-ever race , Toyota never won a Grand Prix , their best finish being 2nd position , which they achieved five times . Toyota drew criticism for their lack of success , as they never managed to win with one of the sport 's biggest budgets . Toyota was a well-funded team , but despite this , strong results had never been consistent . On 4 November 2009 , Toyota announced its immediate withdrawal from Formula One , ending the team 's involvement in the sport after eight consecutive seasons ."

He was also Ferrari 's F1 reserve driver for 2010 .

After several days of confusion regarding rules and technicalities , Fisichella was eventually declared the winner in the following week , and collected his trophy in an unofficial ceremony at the following race .

Due to issues with the Concorde Agreement , the team remained as BMW Sauber for the 2010 season . In March 2010 , Peter Sauber announced plans to change the team name during the season , but the FIA announced that they would have to wait until the end of the season to change their name . At the beginning of the 2011 season the team dropped BMW from their name .

The company also helped develop racing motorcycles like Petronas GP1 . Former Honda and Ferrari engineer Osamu Goto was in charge of the Powertrain Division , including the F1 engine program . The engines were for many years nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari but were branded Petronas . Sauber licensed nearly every legally licensable part from Ferrari and even had several Ferrari engineers on staff . Many pointed out suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis , but no formal accusations were ever made , even if FIA rules require each team to design their own chassis . The long-term aim of Sauber Petronas was to design and build its own F1 engines for the 1999 season but the programme was abandoned , choosing instead to continue with the Ferrari units . In 1998 , Petronas commissioned the Powertrain Division of SPE to design their own first commercial automotive engine , the Petronas E01e engine . After the 2005 season , Sauber was bought by BMW and the co-operation with Ferrari ended ."

        "table_passage_row_old": "Jarno Trulli ( Italian pronunciation : [ \u02c8jarno \u02c8trulli ] ; born 13 July 1974 ) is an Italian racing driver . He regularly competed in Formula One from 1997 to 2011 , driving for Minardi , Prost , Jordan , Renault , Toyota , Lotus Racing and Team Lotus . His best result in the World Drivers ' Championship was sixth place in 2004 ; this was also the year in which he scored the only win of his Formula One career at the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix . Throughout his Formula One career , Trulli was renowned for his skill in qualifying , regularly achieving far better grid positions than rivals with superior cars to his own . He was also known for his defensive driving style which allowed him to successfully hold off quicker drivers , sometimes for an entire race .

The Atlanta-city section of Druid Hills is one of Atlanta 's most affluent neighborhoods with a mean household income in excess of $ 238,500 ( making it the ninth most affluent , per that metric ) .A planetarium ( plural planetaria or planetariums ) is a theatre built primarily for presenting educational and entertaining shows about astronomy and the night sky , or for training in celestial navigation . A dominant feature of most planetaria is the large dome-shaped projection screen onto which scenes of stars , planets , and other celestial objects can be made to appear and move realistically to simulate the complex 'motions of the heavens ' . The celestial scenes can be created using a wide variety of technologies , for example precision-engineered 'star balls ' that combine optical and electro-mechanical technology , slide projector , video and fulldome projector systems , and lasers . Whatever technologies are used , the objective is normally to link them together to simulate an accurate relative motion of the sky . Typical systems can be set to simulate the sky at any point in time , past or present , and often to depict the night sky as it would appear from any point of latitude on Earth . Planetariums range in size from the 37 meter dome in St. Petersburg , Russia ( called Planetarium No 1 ) to three-meter inflatable portable domes where attendees sit on the floor . The largest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere is the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at Liberty Science Center in New Jersey ( 27 meters in diameter ) . The Birla Planetarium in Kolkata , India is the largest by seating capacity ( 630 seats ) . Thereafter , the China Science and Technology Museum Planetarium in Beijing , China has the largest seating capacity ( 442 seats ) . In North America , the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has the greatest number of seats ( 423 ) . The term planetarium is sometimes used generically to describe other devices which illustrate the solar system , such as a computer simulation or an orrery . Planetarium software refers to a software application that renders a three-dimensional image of the sky onto a two-dimensional computer screen . A telescope is an optical instrument that makes distant objects appear magnified by using an arrangement of lenses or curved mirrors and lenses , or various devices used to observe distant objects by their emission , absorption , or reflection of electromagnetic radiation . The first known practical telescopes were refracting telescopes invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century , by using glass lenses . They were used for both terrestrial applications and astronomy . The reflecting telescope , which uses mirrors to collect and focus light , was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope . In the 20th century , many new types of telescopes were invented , including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s . The word telescope now refers to a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum , and in some cases other types of detectors . Fernbank Forest is a 65-acre ( 25 hectares ) mature mixed forest that is part of Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta , Georgia . It has some relatively old trees compared to much of the forests in the Piedmont ; as such , it has been extensively studied by scientists . Large specimens of white oak and tulip poplar , which grow up to 156 feet ( 47.5 meters ) tall , can be found along one slope within the forest . There also are a few equally tall loblolly pine . Other canopy species include American beech , black oak , northern red oak , southern red oak , pignut hickory , bitternut hickory , mockernut hickory , winged elm and red maple . Eastern flowering dogwood , sourwood , umbrella magnolia and eastern redbud are prominent among the smaller trees . The forest floor is covered by many shrub , wildflower , and fern species . Common animals include raccoon , opossum , gray squirrel , chipmunk , American crow , pileated woodpecker , box turtle and several snake species , including the venomous copperhead . The soils are mostly well-drained , with medium brown or dark reddish brown sandy loam topsoils . The subsoils are clay loam or clay ; they are medium red or dark red .

He is a former world record holder in the marathon - His time of 2:03:38 , run at the 2011 Berlin Marathon , was the world record for two years , until it was beaten by Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich at the 2013 Berlin Marathon . He is also notable for his half marathon performances , having won a number of prominent competitions in Europe in sub-1-hour performances .Kenya ( /\u02c8k\u025bnj\u0259/ ( listen ) ) , officially the Republic of Kenya ( Swahili : Jamhuri ya Kenya ) , is a country in Africa with 47 semiautonomous counties governed by elected governors . At 580,367 square kilometres ( 224,081 sq mi ) , Kenya is the world 's 48th largest country by total area . With a population of more than 47.6 million people , Kenya is the 29th most populous country . Kenya 's capital and largest city is Nairobi , while its oldest city and first capital is the coastal city of Mombasa . Kisumu City is the third largest city and also an inland port on Lake Victoria . Other important urban centres include Nakuru and Eldoret . Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest , Ethiopia to the north , Somalia to the east , Uganda to the west , Tanzania to the south , and the Indian Ocean to the southeast . According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material , the Cushites first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 3,200 and 1,300 BC , a phase referred to as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic .

As soon as the incident happened , Pel\u00e9 ran and jumped over the fence to help the injured people . [ citation needed ] Only minor injuries occurred and the match proceeded , ending in a 2-2 draw . Though the stadium is the home ground of Club Olimpia , the Defensores del Chaco stadium is used for major derbies against their rivals such as Cerro Porte\u00f1o because of its greater capacity . The stadium is nicknamed The Forest of Stop One on account of its surroundings constituting large , tall trees , and the location having been the first stop of a now defunct Paraguayan train ."

        "table_passage_row_old": "William Henry Gates III ( born October 28 , 1955 ) is an American business magnate , software developer , investor , and philanthropist . He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation . During his career at Microsoft , Gates held the positions of chairman , chief executive officer ( CEO ) , president and chief software architect , while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014 . He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s . Born and raised in Seattle , Washington , Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975 in Albuquerque , New Mexico ; it went on to become the world 's largest personal computer software company . [ a ] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000 , but he remained chairman and became chief software architect . During the late 1990s , Gates had been criticized for his business tactics , which have been considered anti-competitive . This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings . In June 2006 , Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , the private charitable foundation that he and his wife , Melinda Gates , established in 2000 . He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie . He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella . Since 1987 , he has been included in the Forbes list of the world 's wealthiest documented individuals .The United States of America ( USA ) , commonly known as the United States ( U.S. or US ) or America , is a country consisting of 50 states , a federal district , five major self-governing territories , and various possessions . [ g ] At 3.8 million square miles ( 9.8 million km2 ) , it is the world 's third or fourth-largest country by total area [ b ] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe . Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico . With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world . The capital is Washington , D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago . European colonization began in the 16th century . The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolutionary War lasting between 1775 and 1783 , leading to independence . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century - gradually acquiring new territories , displacing Native Americans , and admitting new states - until by 1848 it spanned the continent . During the second half of the 19th century , the American Civil War led to the abolition of slavery in the United States . The Spanish-American War and World War I confirmed the country 's status as a global military power .Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond , Washington . It develops , manufactures , licenses , supports , and sells computer software , consumer electronics , personal computers , and related services . Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems , the Microsoft Office suite , and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers . Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers . In 2016 , it was the world 's largest software maker by revenue ( currently Alphabet/Google has more revenue ) . The word Microsoft is a portmanteau of microcomputer and software . Microsoft is ranked No . 30 in the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue . Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4 , 1975 , to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 . It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s , followed by Microsoft Windows .

It covers an area of 30,689 km2 ( 11,849 sq mi ) and has a population of more than 11.5 million , making it the 22nd most densely populated country in the world and the 6th most densely populated country in Europe , with a density of 376 per square kilometre ( 970/sq mi ) . The capital and largest city is Brussels ; other major cities are Antwerp , Ghent , Charleroi and Li\u00e8ge . The sovereign state is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system . Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds . It is divided into three highly autonomous regions : the Flemish Region in the north , Wallonia in the south , and the Brussels-Capital Region . Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region , as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita . Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or communities : the Dutch-speaking Flemish Community , which constitutes about 60 percent of the population , and the French-speaking Community , which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians . A small German-speaking Community , numbering around one percent , exists in the East Cantons . The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual ( French and Dutch ) , although French is the dominant language . Belgium 's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its political history and complex system of governance , made up of six different governments ."

She was the mother of the next and second ruler of the Ottoman State , Orhan .The Oghuz , Oguz or Ghuzz Turks ( Middle Turkic : \u0671\u063a\u064f\u0632 O\u03b3uz , Old Turkic : \ud803\udc06\ud803\udc0d\ud803\udc14 , romanized : O\u03b3uz ) were western Turkic people who spoke the Oghuz languages from the Common branch of the Turkic language family . In the 8th century , they formed a tribal confederation conventionally named the Oghuz Yabgu State in central Asia . The name Oghuz is a Common Turkic word for tribe . Byzantine sources call the Oghuz the Uzes ( \u039f\u1f50\u0311\u03b6\u03bf\u03b9 , Ouzoi ) . By the 10th century , Islamic sources were calling them Muslim Turkmens , as opposed to shamanist or Buddhist . By the 12th century this term had passed into Byzantine usage and the Oghuzes were overwhelmingly Muslim . The term 'Oghuz ' was gradually supplanted among the Turks themselves by Turkmen and Turcoman , ( Ottoman Turkish : \u062a\u0631\u0643\u0645\u0646\u0644\u0631 , romanized : T\u00fcrkmen or T\u00fcrkm\u00e2n ) from the mid 900 's on , a process which was completed by the beginning of the 1200s . Mahmud al-Kashgari says that Turkmen has a broader meaning by saying that Karluks are also Turkmens but differ from Oghuz . The Oghuz confederation migrated westward from the Jeti-su area after a conflict with the Karluk allies of the Uyghurs . Today , a percentage of the residents of Turkey , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are descendants of Oghuz Turks and their language belongs to the Oghuz group of the Turkic languages family . In the 9th century , the Oghuzes from the Aral steppes drove Bechens from the Emba and Ural River region toward the west . In the 10th century , they inhabited the steppe of the rivers Sari-su , Turgai , and Emba to the north of Lake Balkhash of modern-day Kazakhstan . Anatolia ( from Greek : \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae , Anatol\u1e17 , east or [ sun ] rise ; Turkish : Anadolu ) , also known as Asia Minor ( Medieval and Modern Greek : \u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 , Mikr\u00e1 As\u00eda , small Asia ; Turkish : K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Asya ) , Asian Turkey , the Anatolian peninsula or the Anatolian plateau , is a large peninsula in West Asia and the westernmost protrusion of the Asian continent . It makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey . The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north , the Mediterranean Sea to the south , the Armenian Highlands to the east and the Aegean Sea to the west . The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Europe . The eastern border of Anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the Gulf of Alexandretta and the Black Sea , bounded by the Armenian Highland to the east and Mesopotamia to the southeast . Thus , traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey . Today , Anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey , which comprises almost the entire country ; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be Turkey 's eastern border . By some definitions , the Armenian Highlands lies beyond the boundary of the Anatolian plateau . The official name of this inland region is the Eastern Anatolia Region . The ancient inhabitants of Anatolia spoke the now-extinct Anatolian languages , which were largely replaced by the Greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic , Roman and Byzantine periods . Major Anatolian languages included Hittite , Luwian , and Lydian , among other more poorly attested relatives . The Turkification of Anatolia began under the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and continued under the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and early 20th centuries . Sheikh Edebali ( 1206 - 1326 ) , also referred as Bal\u0131\u015feyh , was a highly influential Turkish Sunni Sheikh , who helped shape and develop the policies of the growing Ottoman State .Orhan Gazi ( Ottoman Turkish : \u0627\u0648\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646 \u063a\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u060c \u0627\u0648\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0631\u0637\u063a\u0631\u0644 ; Turkish : Orhan Gazi ) ( c. 1281 - March 1362 ) was the second bey of the nascent Ottoman Sultanate ( then known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate ) from 1323/4 to 1362 . He was born in S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct , as the son of Osman Gazi and Malhun Hatun . His grandfather was Ertu\u011frul . In the early stages of his reign , Orhan focused his energies on conquering most of northwestern Anatolia . The majority of these areas were under Byzantine rule and he won his first battle at Pelekanon against the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos . Orhan also occupied the lands of the Karasids of Bal\u0131kesir and the Ahis of Ankara .

In the 8th century , they formed a tribal confederation conventionally named the Oghuz Yabgu State in central Asia . The name Oghuz is a Common Turkic word for tribe . Byzantine sources call the Oghuz the Uzes ( \u039f\u1f50\u0311\u03b6\u03bf\u03b9 , Ouzoi ) . By the 10th century , Islamic sources were calling them Muslim Turkmens , as opposed to shamanist or Buddhist . By the 12th century this term had passed into Byzantine usage and the Oghuzes were overwhelmingly Muslim .

They rebelled against the central power in 1283 , upon the execution of the sultan Kaykhusraw III by the Mongols , and placing of Mesud II on the Seljuq throne .

The majority of Serbs inhabit the nation state of Serbia , as well as the disputed territory of Kosovo , [ a ] and the neighboring countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia and Montenegro . They form significant minorities in North Macedonia and Slovenia . There is a large Serb diaspora in Western Europe , and outside Europe and there are significant communities in North America and Australia . The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of Southeast Europe . They are predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians by religion . The Serbian language is official in Serbia , co-official in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina , and is spoken by the plurality in Montenegro . Italians ( Italian : italiani [ ita\u02c8lja\u02d0ni ] ) are a Romance ethnic group and nation native to the Italian geographical region and its neighbouring insular territories . Italians share a common culture , history , ancestry and language . All Italian nationals are citizens of Italy , regardless of ancestry or nation of residence ( in effect , however , Italian nationality is largely based on jus sanguinis ) and may be distinguished from ethnic Italians in general or people of Italian descent without Italian citizenship and from ethnic Italians living in territories adjacent to the Italian peninsula without Italian citizenship . The majority of Italian nationals are native speakers of the country 's official language , Italian , or a regional variety thereof . However , many of them also speak a regional or minority language native to Italy , the existence of which predates the national language ; although there is disagreement on the total number , according to UNESCO there are approximately 30 languages native to Italy , although many are often misleadingly referred to as Italian dialects . In 2017 , in addition to about 55 million Italians in Italy ( 91% of the Italian national population ) , Italian-speaking autonomous groups are found in neighbouring nations : almost a quarter million are in Switzerland , a large population is in France , the entire population of San Marino , and there are smaller groups in Slovenia and Croatia , primarily in Istria ( Istrian Italians ) and Dalmatia ( Dalmatian Italians ) . Because of the wide-ranging diaspora , about 5 million Italian citizens and nearly 80 million people of full or partial Italian ancestry live outside their own homeland , which includes 62.5% of Argentina 's population ( Italian Argentines ) , 1/3 of Uruguayans ( Italian Uruguayans ) , 15% of Brazilians ( Italian Brazilians , the largest Italian community outside Italy ) , and people in other parts of Europe , the Americas ( such as Italian Americans , Italian Canadians , Italian Mexicans and Italo-Venezuelans , among others ) , Australasia ( Italian Australians and Italian New Zealanders ) , and to a lesser extent in the Middle East ( see Italian diaspora ) .

Hatun ( Persian : \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0646 kh\u0101t\u016bn ) is a Persian name ( Originally from Eastern Iranian language , Sogdian ) and used as an honorific for women during the Ottoman period . The Serbs ( Serbian : \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438 , romanized : Srbi , pronounced [ sr\u0329\u0302bi ] ) are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group that formed in the Balkans . The majority of Serbs inhabit the nation state of Serbia , as well as the disputed territory of Kosovo , [ a ] and the neighboring countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia and Montenegro . They form significant minorities in North Macedonia and Slovenia . There is a large Serb diaspora in Western Europe , and outside Europe and there are significant communities in North America and Australia . The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of Southeast Europe . They are predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians by religion . The Serbian language is official in Serbia , co-official in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina , and is spoken by the plurality in Montenegro . Italians ( Italian : italiani [ ita\u02c8lja\u02d0ni ] ) are a Romance ethnic group and nation native to the Italian geographical region and its neighbouring insular territories . Italians share a common culture , history , ancestry and language . All Italian nationals are citizens of Italy , regardless of ancestry or nation of residence ( in effect , however , Italian nationality is largely based on jus sanguinis ) and may be distinguished from ethnic Italians in general or people of Italian descent without Italian citizenship and from ethnic Italians living in territories adjacent to the Italian peninsula without Italian citizenship . The majority of Italian nationals are native speakers of the country 's official language , Italian , or a regional variety thereof . However , many of them also speak a regional or minority language native to Italy , the existence of which predates the national language ; although there is disagreement on the total number , according to UNESCO there are approximately 30 languages native to Italy , although many are often misleadingly referred to as Italian dialects . In 2017 , in addition to about 55 million Italians in Italy ( 91% of the Italian national population ) , Italian-speaking autonomous groups are found in neighbouring nations : almost a quarter million are in Switzerland , a large population is in France , the entire population of San Marino , and there are smaller groups in Slovenia and Croatia , primarily in Istria ( Istrian Italians ) and Dalmatia ( Dalmatian Italians ) . Because of the wide-ranging diaspora , about 5 million Italian citizens and nearly 80 million people of full or partial Italian ancestry live outside their own homeland , which includes 62.5% of Argentina 's population ( Italian Argentines ) , 1/3 of Uruguayans ( Italian Uruguayans ) , 15% of Brazilians ( Italian Brazilians , the largest Italian community outside Italy ) , and people in other parts of Europe , the Americas ( such as Italian Americans , Italian Canadians , Italian Mexicans and Italo-Venezuelans , among others ) , Australasia ( Italian Australians and Italian New Zealanders ) , and to a lesser extent in the Middle East ( see Italian diaspora ) .

One of the Cyclades island group , it lies to the west of Naxos , from which it is separated by a channel about 8 kilometres ( 5 miles ) wide . It lies approximately 150 km ( 93 miles ) south-east of Piraeus . The Municipality of Paros includes numerous uninhabited offshore islets totaling 196.308 square kilometres ( 75.795 sq mi ) of land . Its nearest neighbor is the municipality of Antiparos , which lies to its southwest . In ancient Greece , the city-state of Paros was located on the island . Historically , Paros was known for its fine white marble , which gave rise to the term Parian to describe marble or china of similar qualities . Today , abandoned marble quarries and mines can be found on the island , but Paros is primarily known as a popular tourist spot . The Republic of Venice ( Italian : Repubblica di Venezia ; Venetian : Rep\u00f9blica de Ven\u00e8sia ) or Venetian Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Veneta ; Venetian : Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta ) , traditionally known as La Serenissima ( English : Most Serene Republic of Venice ; Italian : Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia ; Venetian : Seren\u00ecsima Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta ) , was a sovereign state and maritime republic in what is now northeastern Italy . It lasted from 697 AD until 1797 AD . Centered on the lagoon communities of the prosperous city of Venice , the republic grew into a trading power during the Middle Ages and strengthened this position in the Renaissance . Citizens spoke the still-surviving Venetian language , although publishing in ( Florentine ) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance . The Venetian city state was founded as a safe haven for the people escaping persecution in mainland Europe after the decline of the Roman Empire . [ citation needed ] In its early years , it prospered on the salt trade . In subsequent centuries , the city state established a thalassocracy . It dominated trade on the Mediterranean Sea , including commerce between Europe and North Africa , as well as Asia . The Venetian navy was used in the Crusades , most notably in the Fourth Crusade . However , Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the Patriarch of Venice and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries . Venice achieved territorial conquests along the Adriatic Sea . Venice became home to an extremely wealthy merchant class , who patronized renowned art and architecture along the city 's lagoons . Jews or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation , originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah . Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah .

She was one of the most prominent figures during the time of the Sultanate of Women . Conflicting theories ascribe her a Venetian , Jewish or Greek origin . Her birth name may have been Cecilia Venier-Baffo , Rachel or Kal\u0113 Kartanou .

The Republic of Venice ( Italian : Repubblica di Venezia ; Venetian : Rep\u00f9blica de Ven\u00e8sia ) or Venetian Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Veneta ; Venetian : Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta ) , traditionally known as La Serenissima ( English : Most Serene Republic of Venice ; Italian : Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia ; Venetian : Seren\u00ecsima Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta ) , was a sovereign state and maritime republic in what is now northeastern Italy . It lasted from 697 AD until 1797 AD . Centered on the lagoon communities of the prosperous city of Venice , the republic grew into a trading power during the Middle Ages and strengthened this position in the Renaissance . Citizens spoke the still-surviving Venetian language , although publishing in ( Florentine ) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance . The Venetian city state was founded as a safe haven for the people escaping persecution in mainland Europe after the decline of the Roman Empire . [ citation needed ] In its early years , it prospered on the salt trade . In subsequent centuries , the city state established a thalassocracy . It dominated trade on the Mediterranean Sea , including commerce between Europe and North Africa , as well as Asia . The Venetian navy was used in the Crusades , most notably in the Fourth Crusade . However , Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the Patriarch of Venice and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries . Venice achieved territorial conquests along the Adriatic Sea . Venice became home to an extremely wealthy merchant class , who patronized renowned art and architecture along the city 's lagoons . Paros ( /\u02c8p\u025b\u0259r\u0252s/ ; Greek : \u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ; Venetian : Paro ) is a Greek island in the central Aegean Sea . One of the Cyclades island group , it lies to the west of Naxos , from which it is separated by a channel about 8 kilometres ( 5 miles ) wide . It lies approximately 150 km ( 93 miles ) south-east of Piraeus . The Municipality of Paros includes numerous uninhabited offshore islets totaling 196.308 square kilometres ( 75.795 sq mi ) of land . Its nearest neighbor is the municipality of Antiparos , which lies to its southwest . In ancient Greece , the city-state of Paros was located on the island . Historically , Paros was known for its fine white marble , which gave rise to the term Parian to describe marble or china of similar qualities . Today , abandoned marble quarries and mines can be found on the island , but Paros is primarily known as a popular tourist spot . Jews or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation , originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah . Jewish ethnicity , nationhood , and religion are strongly interrelated , as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people , while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance . Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE , in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel . The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE ( Late Bronze Age ) . The Israelites , as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population , consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah . Some consider that these Canaanite sedentary Israelites melded with incoming nomadic groups known as 'Hebrews ' . Though few sources mention the exilic periods in detail , the experience of diaspora life , from the Ancient Egyptian rule over the Levant , to Assyrian captivity and exile , to Babylonian captivity and exile , to Seleucid Imperial rule , to the Roman occupation and exile , and the historical relations between Jews and their homeland thereafter , became a major feature of Jewish history , identity and memory .

A large Abkhaz diaspora population resides in Turkey , the origins of which lie in the population movements from the Caucasus in the late 19th century . Many Abkhaz also live in other parts of the former Soviet Union , particularly in Russia and Ukraine ."

K\u00f6sem Sultan achieved power and influenced the politics of the Ottoman Empire when she became haseki sultan as favourite consort and later second legal wife of Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I ( r. 1603-1617 ) ( after Mahfiruze Hatice Sultan , who was the Sultan 's first legal wife ) and valide sultan as mother of Murad IV ( r. 1623-1640 ) and Ibrahim ( r. 1640-1648 ) , and grandmother of Mehmed IV ( r. 1648-1687 ) . K\u00f6sem lived in the Ottoman Empire as a courtier during the reign of six sultans : Ahmed I , Mustafa I , Osman II , Murad IV , Ibrahim , and Mehmed IV . After her death , she was known by the names Valide-i Muazzama ( magnificent mother ) , V\u0101lide-i Ma\u1e33t\u016ble ( murdered mother ) , and V\u0101lide-i \u015eeh\u012bde ( martyred mother ) .Haseki Sultan ( Ottoman Turkish : \u062e\u0627\u0635\u06a9\u0649 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 , \u1e2a\u0101\u1e63ek\u012b Sul\u1e6d\u0101n ; Turkish pronunciation : [ hase\u02c8ci su\u026b\u02c8ta\u02d0n ] ) was the imperial title used for the chief consort of an Ottoman Sultan . Haseki sultan meant chief consort or single favorite of the sultan . In later years , the meaning of the title changed to imperial consort . H\u00fcrrem Sultan , principal consort and legal wife of Suleiman the Magnificent , was the first holder of this title . The title haseki sultan was only used until the 17th century . After that , Kad\u0131nefendi became the highest ranking title for imperial consorts . Valide sultan ( Ottoman Turkish : \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 , lit . mother sultan ) was the title held by the legal mother of a ruling sultan of the Ottoman Empire . The title was first used in the 16th century for Hafsa Sultan ( died 1534 ) , consort of Selim I ( r. 1512-1520 ) and mother of Suleiman the Magnificent ( r. 1520-1566 ) , superseding the previous title of mehd-i ulya ( cradle of the great ) . Normally , the living mother of a reigning sultan held this title . Those mothers who died before their sons ' accession to the throne were never bestowed with the title of Valide Sultan . In special cases , grandmothers and stepmothers of a reigning sultan assumed the title Valide Sultan . A regent ( from the Latin regens : ruling , governing ) is a person appointed to govern a state because the monarch is a minor , is absent , or is incapacitated . The rule of a regent or regents is called a regency . A regent or regency council may be formed ad hoc or in accordance with a constitutional rule . Regent is sometimes a formal title . If the regent is holding his position due to his position in the line of succession , the compound term prince regent is often used ; if the regent of a minor is his mother , she is often referred to as queen regent . If the formally appointed regent is unavailable or can not serve on a temporary basis , a regent ad interim may be appointed to fill the gap . In a monarchy , a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons , but may also be elected to rule during the interregnum when the royal line has died out . This was the case in the Kingdom of Finland and the Kingdom of Hungary , where the royal line was considered extinct in the aftermath of World War I . In Iceland , the regent represented the King of Denmark as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944 . In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ( 1569-1795 ) , kings were elective , which often led to a fairly long interregnum . In the interim , it was the Roman Catholic primate ( the archbishop of Gniezno ) who served as the regent , termed the interrex ( Latin : ruler 'between kings ' as in ancient Rome ) . In the small republic of San Marino , the two Captains Regent , or Capitani Reggenti , are elected semi-annually ( they serve a six-month term ) as joint heads of state and of government .The Greeks or Hellenes ( /\u02c8h\u025bli\u02d0nz/ ; Greek : \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 , \u00c9llines [ \u02c8elines ] ) are an ethnic group native to Greece , Cyprus , Albania , Italy , Turkey , Egypt and , to a lesser extent , other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea . They also form a significant diaspora , with Greek communities established around the world . Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea , but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas , where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age . Until the early 20th century , Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula , the western coast of Asia Minor , the Black Sea coast , Cappadocia in central Anatolia , Egypt , the Balkans , Cyprus , and Constantinople . Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization . The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens , Thessalonica , Alexandria , Smyrna , and Constantinople at various periods . In recent times , most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus . The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor . Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries . Today , most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox Church . Throughout history , Greeks have greatly influenced and contributed to culture , visual arts , exploration , theatre , literature , philosophy , politics , architecture , music , mathematics , medicine , science , technology , commerce , cuisine and sports . Tinos ( Greek : \u03a4\u03ae\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 [ \u02c8tinos ] ) is a Greek island situated in the Aegean Sea . It is located in the Cyclades archipelago . In antiquity , Tinos was also known as Ophiussa ( from ophis , Greek for snake ) and Hydroessa ( from hydor , Greek for water ) . The closest islands are Andros , Delos , and Mykonos . It has a land area of 194.464 square kilometres ( 75.083 sq mi ) and a 2011 census population of 8,636 inhabitants . Tinos is famous amongst Greeks for the Church of Panagia Evangelistria , its 80 or so windmills , about 1000 artistic dovecotes , 50 active villages and its Venetian fortifications at the mountain , Exomvourgo . On Tinos , both Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic populations co-exist , and the island is also well known for its famous sculptors and painters , such as Nikolaos Gysis , Yannoulis Chalepas and Nikiforos Lytras . The island is located near the geographical center of the Cyclades island complex , and because of the Panagia Evangelistria church , with its reputedly miraculous icon of Virgin Mary that it holds , Tinos is also the center of a yearly pilgrimage that takes place on the date of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary ( 15 August , Dekapentavgoustos in Greek ) . This is perhaps the most notable and still active yearly pilgrimage in the region of the eastern Mediterranean . Many pilgrims make their way the 800 metres ( 2,600 feet ) from the ferry wharf to the church on their hands and knees as sign of devotion . The Republic of Venice ( Italian : Repubblica di Venezia ; Venetian : Rep\u00f9blica de Ven\u00e8sia ) or Venetian Republic ( Italian : Repubblica Veneta ; Venetian : Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta ) , traditionally known as La Serenissima ( English : Most Serene Republic of Venice ; Italian : Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia ; Venetian : Seren\u00ecsima Rep\u00f9blica V\u00e8neta ) , was a sovereign state and maritime republic in what is now northeastern Italy . It lasted from 697 AD until 1797 AD . Centered on the lagoon communities of the prosperous city of Venice , the republic grew into a trading power during the Middle Ages and strengthened this position in the Renaissance . Citizens spoke the still-surviving Venetian language , although publishing in ( Florentine ) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance . The Venetian city state was founded as a safe haven for the people escaping persecution in mainland Europe after the decline of the Roman Empire . [ citation needed ] In its early years , it prospered on the salt trade . In subsequent centuries , the city state established a thalassocracy . It dominated trade on the Mediterranean Sea , including commerce between Europe and North Africa , as well as Asia . The Venetian navy was used in the Crusades , most notably in the Fourth Crusade . However , Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the Patriarch of Venice and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries . Venice achieved territorial conquests along the Adriatic Sea . Venice became home to an extremely wealthy merchant class , who patronized renowned art and architecture along the city 's lagoons .Murad IV ( Ottoman Turkish : \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639 , Mur\u0101d-\u0131 R\u0101bi\u02bf ; 27 July 1612 - 8 February 1640 ) was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1623 to 1640 , known both for restoring the authority of the state and for the brutality of his methods . Murad IV was born in Constantinople , the son of Sultan Ahmed I ( r. 1603-17 ) and K\u00f6sem Sultan . He was brought to power by a palace conspiracy in 1623 , and he succeeded his uncle Mustafa I ( r. 1617-18 , 1622-23 ) . He was only 11 when he ascended the throne . His reign is most notable for the Ottoman-Safavid War ( 1623-39 ) , of which the outcome would permanently part the Caucasus between the two Imperial powers for around two centuries , while it also roughly laid the foundation for the current Turkey-Iran-Iraq borders .

Turhan was prominent for the regency of her young son and her building patronage . She and her mother-in-law , K\u00f6sem Sultan , are the only two women in Ottoman history to be regarded as official regents and had supreme control over the Ottoman Empire . Turhan herself was the only one in Ottoman history to equally share the power of running the entire empire with Ottoman Sultan legally , although in fact she transferred her political power to the grand vizier . As a result , Turhan became one of the prominent figures during the era known as Sultanate of Women .Haseki Sultan ( Ottoman Turkish : \u062e\u0627\u0635\u06a9\u0649 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 , \u1e2a\u0101\u1e63ek\u012b Sul\u1e6d\u0101n ; Turkish pronunciation : [ hase\u02c8ci su\u026b\u02c8ta\u02d0n ] ) was the imperial title used for the chief consort of an Ottoman Sultan . Haseki sultan meant chief consort or single favorite of the sultan . In later years , the meaning of the title changed to imperial consort . H\u00fcrrem Sultan , principal consort and legal wife of Suleiman the Magnificent , was the first holder of this title . The title haseki sultan was only used until the 17th century . After that , Kad\u0131nefendi became the highest ranking title for imperial consorts . Valide sultan ( Ottoman Turkish : \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 , lit . mother sultan ) was the title held by the legal mother of a ruling sultan of the Ottoman Empire . The title was first used in the 16th century for Hafsa Sultan ( died 1534 ) , consort of Selim I ( r. 1512-1520 ) and mother of Suleiman the Magnificent ( r. 1520-1566 ) , superseding the previous title of mehd-i ulya ( cradle of the great ) . Normally , the living mother of a reigning sultan held this title . Those mothers who died before their sons ' accession to the throne were never bestowed with the title of Valide Sultan . In special cases , grandmothers and stepmothers of a reigning sultan assumed the title Valide Sultan . A regent ( from the Latin regens : ruling , governing ) is a person appointed to govern a state because the monarch is a minor , is absent , or is incapacitated . The rule of a regent or regents is called a regency . A regent or regency council may be formed ad hoc or in accordance with a constitutional rule . Regent is sometimes a formal title . If the regent is holding his position due to his position in the line of succession , the compound term prince regent is often used ; if the regent of a minor is his mother , she is often referred to as queen regent . If the formally appointed regent is unavailable or can not serve on a temporary basis , a regent ad interim may be appointed to fill the gap . In a monarchy , a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons , but may also be elected to rule during the interregnum when the royal line has died out . This was the case in the Kingdom of Finland and the Kingdom of Hungary , where the royal line was considered extinct in the aftermath of World War I . In Iceland , the regent represented the King of Denmark as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944 . In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ( 1569-1795 ) , kings were elective , which often led to a fairly long interregnum . In the interim , it was the Roman Catholic primate ( the archbishop of Gniezno ) who served as the regent , termed the interrex ( Latin : ruler 'between kings ' as in ancient Rome ) . In the small republic of San Marino , the two Captains Regent , or Capitani Reggenti , are elected semi-annually ( they serve a six-month term ) as joint heads of state and of government .Russians ( Russian : \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 , tr . russkiye , IPA : \u02c8rusk\u02b2\u026aje ) are an East Slavic ethnic group native to European Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe ( some territories of the former Tsardom of Russia and Russian Empire ) ; they are the most numerous ethnic group in Europe .

For centuries , Poland was home to the largest and most significant Jewish community in the world . Poland was a principal center of Jewish culture , thanks to a long period of statutory religious tolerance and social autonomy which ended with the Partitions of Poland in the 18th century . During World War II there was a nearly complete genocidal destruction of the Polish Jewish community by Nazi Germany and its collaborators , during the 1939-1945 German occupation of Poland and the ensuing Holocaust . Since the fall of communism in Poland , there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture , featuring an annual Jewish Culture Festival , new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities , and Warsaw 's Museum of the History of Polish Jews . From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in 1025 through to the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth created in 1569 , Poland was the most tolerant country in Europe . Historians have used the label paradisus iudaeorum ( Latin for Paradise of the Jews ) . The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world 's largest Jewish community of the time . According to some sources , about three-quarters of the world 's Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century . With the weakening of the Commonwealth and growing religious strife ( due to the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation ) , Poland 's traditional tolerance began to wane from the 17th century onward . After the Partitions of Poland in 1795 and the destruction of Poland as a sovereign state , Polish Jews were subject to the laws of the partitioning powers , the increasingly antisemitic Russian Empire , as well as Austria-Hungary and Kingdom of Prussia ( later a part of the German Empire ) . Still , as Poland regained independence in the aftermath of World War I , it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world 's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million . The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - formally , the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and , after 1791 , the Commonwealth of Poland - was a dual state , a bi-confederation of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch , who was both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- to 17th-century Europe . At its largest territorial extent , in the early 17th century , the Commonwealth covered almost 400,000 square miles ( 1,000,000 km2 ) and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million . Polish and Latin were the two co-official languages . The Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569 , but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been in a de facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania 's Grand Duke Jogaila , who was crowned King jure uxoris W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o of Poland . The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the state 's size and the Commonwealth collapsed as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 . The Union possessed many features unique among contemporary states . Its political system was characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power . These checks were enacted by a legislature ( sejm ) controlled by the nobility ( szlachta ) . This idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy , constitutional monarchy , and federation . Although the two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal , Poland was the dominant partner in the union . The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic diversity and by relative religious tolerance , guaranteed by the Warsaw Confederation Act 1573 ; [ a ] however , the degree of religious freedom varied over time .Ahmed II ( Ottoman Turkish : \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062b\u0627\u0646\u0649 A\u1e25med-i s\u0101n\u012b ) ( 25 February 1643 or 1 August 1642 - 6 February 1695 ) was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1691 to 1695 .",

The Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569 , but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been in a de facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania 's Grand Duke Jogaila , who was crowned King jure uxoris W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o of Poland . The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the state 's size and the Commonwealth collapsed as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 . The Union possessed many features unique among contemporary states . Its political system was characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power . These checks were enacted by a legislature ( sejm ) controlled by the nobility ( szlachta ) . This idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy , constitutional monarchy , and federation . Although the two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal , Poland was the dominant partner in the union . The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic diversity and by relative religious tolerance , guaranteed by the Warsaw Confederation Act 1573 ; [ a ] however , the degree of religious freedom varied over time . The history of the Jews in Poland dates back over 1,000 years . For centuries , Poland was home to the largest and most significant Jewish community in the world . Poland was a principal center of Jewish culture , thanks to a long period of statutory religious tolerance and social autonomy which ended with the Partitions of Poland in the 18th century . During World War II there was a nearly complete genocidal destruction of the Polish Jewish community by Nazi Germany and its collaborators , during the 1939-1945 German occupation of Poland and the ensuing Holocaust . Since the fall of communism in Poland , there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture , featuring an annual Jewish Culture Festival , new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities , and Warsaw 's Museum of the History of Polish Jews . From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in 1025 through to the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth created in 1569 , Poland was the most tolerant country in Europe . Historians have used the label paradisus iudaeorum ( Latin for Paradise of the Jews ) . The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world 's largest Jewish community of the time . According to some sources , about three-quarters of the world 's Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century . With the weakening of the Commonwealth and growing religious strife ( due to the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation ) , Poland 's traditional tolerance began to wane from the 17th century onward . After the Partitions of Poland in 1795 and the destruction of Poland as a sovereign state , Polish Jews were subject to the laws of the partitioning powers , the increasingly antisemitic Russian Empire , as well as Austria-Hungary and Kingdom of Prussia ( later a part of the German Empire ) . Still , as Poland regained independence in the aftermath of World War I , it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world 's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million ."

Haseki sultan meant chief consort or single favorite of the sultan . In later years , the meaning of the title changed to imperial consort .

They also form a significant diaspora , with Greek communities established around the world . Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea , but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas , where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age . Until the early 20th century , Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula , the western coast of Asia Minor , the Black Sea coast , Cappadocia in central Anatolia , Egypt , the Balkans , Cyprus , and Constantinople . Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization . The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens , Thessalonica , Alexandria , Smyrna , and Constantinople at various periods . In recent times , most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus . The Greek genocide and population exchange between Greece and Turkey nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor . Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine and in the Greek diaspora communities in a number of other countries . Today , most Greeks are officially registered as members of the Greek Orthodox Church .

Rethymno was originally built during the Minoan civilization ( ancient Rhithymna and Arsinoe ) . The city was prominent enough to mint its own coins and maintain urban growth .

It lasted from 697 AD until 1797 AD . Centered on the lagoon communities of the prosperous city of Venice , the republic grew into a trading power during the Middle Ages and strengthened this position in the Renaissance . Citizens spoke the still-surviving Venetian language , although publishing in ( Florentine ) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance . The Venetian city state was founded as a safe haven for the people escaping persecution in mainland Europe after the decline of the Roman Empire .

It dominated trade on the Mediterranean Sea , including commerce between Europe and North Africa , as well as Asia . The Venetian navy was used in the Crusades , most notably in the Fourth Crusade . However , Venice perceived Rome as an enemy and maintained high levels of religious and ideological independence personified by the Patriarch of Venice and a highly-developed independent publishing industry that served as a haven from Roman Catholic censorship for many centuries . Venice achieved territorial conquests along the Adriatic Sea .

The film 's script is loosely based on two X-Men comic book story arcs : The Dark Phoenix Saga by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne , and Gifted by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday , with a plot that revolves around a mutant cure that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans , and on the resurrection of Jean Grey . Bryan Singer , who had directed the two previous films , X-Men ( 2000 ) and X2 , decided to leave the sequel to work on Superman Returns . X2 composer John Ottman and X2 writers Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty also left to work on Superman Returns , as did James Marsden , who had very limited screen time in The Last Stand before his character was killed off due to his departure from the film .

Set at an unspecified date in Earth 's future , the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with the Formics , an insectoid alien species they dub the buggers . In preparation for an anticipated third invasion , children , including the novel 's protagonist , Andrew Ender Wiggin , are trained from a very young age by putting them through increasingly difficult games , including some in zero gravity , where Ender 's tactical genius is revealed . The book originated as a short story of the same name , published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact . The novel was published on January 15 , 1985 . Later , by elaborating on characters and plot lines depicted in the novel , Card was able to write additional books in the Ender 's Game series . Card also released an updated version of Ender 's Game in 1991 , changing some political facts to reflect the times more accurately ( e.g. , to include the recent collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War ) . The novel has been translated into 34 languages . Reception of the book has been mostly positive but many have criticised its politics . It has become suggested reading for many military organizations , including the United States Marine Corps .

The winning novel is selected by a panel of science fiction experts , intended to be small enough to discuss among its members all of the nominated novels . Among members of the panel have been Gregory Benford , Paul A. Carter , James Gunn , Elizabeth Anne Hull , Christopher McKitterick , Farah Mendlesohn , Pamela Sargent , and Tom Shippey . In 2008 Mendlesohn was replaced with Paul Kincaid , in 2009 Carter left the panel while Paul Di Filippo and Sheila Finch joined , and Lisa Yaszek replaced Di Filippo in 2016 . Nominations are submitted by publishers and jurors , and are collated by the panel into a list of finalists to be voted on . The minimum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center . The winner is selected by May of each year , and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Sturgeon Award .
