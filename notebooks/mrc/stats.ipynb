Section 15 ( `` statutory rape '' ) prohibits the commission of `` an act of sexual penetration with a child who is 12 years of age or older but under the age of 16 years '' , while section 16 ( `` statutory sexual assault '' ) prohibits the commission of `` an act of sexual violation with a child who is 12 years of age or older but under the age of 16 years '' . The law includes a close - in - age exception , so that sexual acts between two children where both are between 12 and 16 , or where one is under 16 and the other is less than two years older , are not criminal .

      "423844969967193932\twhen does sigma factor normally dissociate from rna polymerase\tb\"The core RNA polymerase ( consisting of 2 alpha ( \\xce\\xb1 ) , 1 beta ( \\xce\\xb2 ) , 1 beta - prime ( \\xce\\xb2 ' ) , and 1 omega ( \\xcf\\x89 ) subunits ) binds a sigma factor to form a complex called the RNA polymerase holoenzyme . It was previously believed that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme initiates transcription , while the core RNA polymerase alone synthesizes RNA . Thus , the accepted view was that sigma factor must dissociate upon transition from transcription initiation to transcription elongation ( this transition is called `` promoter escape '' ) . This view was based on analysis of purified complexes of RNA polymerase stalled at initiation and at elongation . Finally , structural models of RNA polymerase complexes predict that , as the growing RNA product becomes longer than ~ 15 nucleotides , sigma must be `` pushed out '' of the holoenzyme , since there is a steric clash between RNA and a sigma domain . However , a recent study has shown that \\xcf\\x83 can remain attached in complex with the core RNA polymerase , at least during early elongation . Indeed , the phenomenon of promoter - proximal pausing indicates that sigma plays roles during early elongation . All studies are consistent with the assumption that promoter escape reduces the lifetime of the sigma - core interaction from very long at initiation ( too long to be measured in a typical biochemical experiment ) to a shorter , measurable lifetime upon transition to elongation .\"\t\n",

It requires `` reasonable '' governmental searches and seizures to be conducted only upon issuance of a warrant , judicially sanctioned by probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized . Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three issues : what government activities constitute `` search '' and `` seizure '' ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed .

Between four and eight cisternae are usually present in a stack ; however , in some protists as many as sixty cisternae have been observed . This collection of cisternae is broken down into cis , medial , and trans compartments , making up two main networks : the cis Golgi network ( CGN ) and the trans Golgi network ( TGN ) . The CGN is the first cisternal structure , and the TGN is the final , from which proteins are packaged into vesicles destined to lysosomes , secretory vesicles , or the cell surface .

      "1888958697169676316\tdifference between comparator and schmitt trigger using op amp\tb\"In electronics , a Schmitt trigger is a comparator circuit with hysteresis implemented by applying positive feedback to the noninverting input of a comparator or differential amplifier . It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal . The circuit is named a `` trigger '' because the output retains its value until the input changes sufficiently to trigger a change . In the non-inverting configuration , when the input is higher than a chosen threshold , the output is high . When the input is below a different ( lower ) chosen threshold the output is low , and when the input is between the two levels the output retains its value . This dual threshold action is called hysteresis and implies that the Schmitt trigger possesses memory and can act as a bistable multivibrator ( latch or flip - flop ) . There is a close relation between the two kinds of circuits : a Schmitt trigger can be converted into a latch and a latch can be converted into a Schmitt trigger .\"\t\n",

Second - order logic also includes quantification over sets , functions , and other variables as explained in the section Syntax and fragments . Both first - order and second - order logic use the idea of a domain of discourse ( often called simply the `` domain '' or the `` universe '' ) .

In the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle , the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion , which is stimulated by FSH . After this is done , a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle , and the secondary oocyte will leave the follicle through this hole .

Tyrion is a member of House Lannister , one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Westeros , and uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life . In May 2009 , he was the first actor to be cast , as showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss noted that Dinklage , whom he described as funny , smart and witty , was their first choice for the role , as the actor 's `` core of humanity , covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit , is pretty well in keeping with the character . '' Unfamiliar with the source material , Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers ; as a dwarf , `` he would n't play elves or leprechauns '' and was choosy about genre roles .

Michael and his two friends Bryson and Sarah , all three talented hackers that can use the game code to manipulate items , are employed by VNS , VirtNet Security , to track down a cyber-terrorist known as Kaine who has been trapping people inside the VirtNet , thus the gamers who are trapped commit suicide in real life by coding out their Cores , the objects that are the layer between their virtual and their real - life bodies . They also want them to find about something called The Mortality Doctrine . Using information from Cutter , a barber in the game Lifeblood , Michael and his friends hack their way into the high - end Black and Blue club . They meet Ronika , the owner , who tells them that to get to Kaine 's supposed base in Hallowed Ravine , they must walk on The Path , which can be accessed through a weak spot in the code within the game Devils of Destruction . However , creatures controlled by Kaine was known as KillSims , which suck the life out of VirtNet players ' Auras - their computer made counterparts - and leave their real - life bodies brain - dead , attack and destroy Ronika , and leave Michael with serious but occasional headaches. Then his friends get very annoyed and frustrated by Michael but do n't say anything because it 's life or death. Michael and his friends then manage to gain access to The Path through Devils of Destruction ( where the people that play it are adults , partly due to the game is for those above 25 years of age , and also because the players have become barbaric ) , which they find very difficult to beat . Once they enter The Path , they find themselves on a massive stone disk with a riddle . After solving it , they enter an infinitely long corridor , from which the only exit is to go through a hole in the wall . At one point , Bryson is ' killed ' by some strange , empty bodies of people , that attack when people passing through unaware . Along the way , they meet Gunner Skale , a formerly legendary gamer , who helps them realize that Kaine is actually a Rogue Tangent , Tangent being the slang term used for an AI in the VirtNet . After escaping from Skale after he tries to kill them , Michael and Sarah continue on The Path , but Sarah also ' dies ' ( meaning she wakes up in her Coffin - the device used to enter the VirtNet - in the real world ) when she is burnt by lava , leaving Michael alone to keep going . Eventually , he reaches a crossroads , where he has a choice of either leaving The Path , or entering the Hallowed Ravine , but with a silver machine destroys his Core when he ' dies ' , so that if he ' dies ' , he dies in real life . After reaching Hallowed Ravine and discovering a Tangent meeting , the VNS sends agents to his location to attack . However , in the ensuing battle , with the KillSims attacking , a large number of VNS agents die . Kaine manages to bring Michael into a room , from where Michael goes away , allowed by Kaine to do so . He is attacked by KillSims , but he uses his powers for the first time to destroy , and not manipulate things . Michael suffers another headache and begs Kaine to save him . Michael then wakes up in a Coffin but realizes his body is different , and also he is in different surroundings . He finds that Kaine left him a message saying that Michael was a Tangent and that he is now the first successful subject of The Mortality Doctrine , which implants Tangent intelligence inside humans , whose intelligence are stored in a quantum computer known as `` The Hive '' . He also says that since he is now human , his headaches , which were actually caused by The Decay , a condition that occurs due to a string of code implemented by the game developers , that causes Tangents to slowly break down .

In wood , one can define three mutually perpendicular directions at each point in which the properties are different . These are the axial direction ( along the grain ) , the radial direction , and the circumferential direction . Because the preferred coordinate system is cylindrical - polar , this type of orthotropy is also called polar orthotropy . Mechanical properties , such as strength and stiffness , measured axially ( along the grain ) are typically better than those measured in the radial and circumferential directions ( across the grain ) .

When a base , or alkali , is dissolved in water , the pH will be greater than 7 . A solution of a strong acid , such as hydrochloric acid , at concentration 1 mol dm has a pH of 0 . A solution of a strong alkali , such as sodium hydroxide , at concentration 1 mol dm , has a pH of 14 . Thus , measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14 , though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible . Since pH is a logarithmic scale , a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration . The pH of neutrality is not exactly 7 ( 25 \\xc2\\xb0 C ) , although this is a good approximation in most cases . Neutrality is defined as the condition where ( H ) = ( OH ) ( or the activities are equal ) . Since self - ionization of water holds the product of these concentration ( H ) \\xc3\\x97 ( OH ) = K , it can be seen that at neutrality ( H ) = ( OH ) = \\xe2\\x88\\x9a K , or pH = pK / 2 . pK is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature , and so the pH of neutrality does also . Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral , since dissociation of water produces equal numbers of both ions . However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions ' activity is dependent on ionic strength , so K varies with ionic strength .\"\t\n",

Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen - containing nucleobases ( cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , adenine ( A ) or thymine ( T ) ) , a sugar called deoxyribose , and a phosphate group . The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next , resulting in an alternating sugar - phosphate backbone . The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together , according to base pairing rules ( A with T and C with G ) , with hydrogen bonds to make double - stranded DNA .'\t\n",

Barlog said that half of the team was for it , but since `` there 's a lot more about civilization - it 's less isolated , less barren '' , he had to make the decision and decided on the Norse setting because they wanted the focus to stay on Kratos : `` Having too much around distracts from that central theme of a stranger in a strange land . '' In explaining why Kratos was now in the Norse world , Barlog said that different cultures ' belief systems coexisted , but they were `` separated by geography '' , suggesting that Kratos traveled from Greece to Norway ( Scandinavia ) after the conclusion of God of War III ; in clarifying the conclusion of that game , Barlog said that Kratos did not destroy what was believed to be the entire world , but only the portion that was ruled over by the Greeks . Barlog said that the new game predates the Vikings ; it is the time in which their gods walked the Earth . It was also confirmed that this would not be Kratos ' last game . Barlog said that future games could see the series tackling Egyptian or Mayan mythology , and that although this game focuses on Norse mythology , it alludes to the fact that there are other mythologies co-existing in the world . Barlog also said that he liked the idea of having different directors for each game , seen throughout the first seven games , and although he may not direct another God of War , he would still be at Santa Monica to work on future games .\"\t\n"
