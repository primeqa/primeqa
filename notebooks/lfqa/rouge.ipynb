      "Question: how is a session key exchanged between a client and server in most secure web transactions\n",
      "Gold Answer: The security of HTTPS is that of the underlying TLS, which typically uses long-term public and private keys to generate a short-term session key, which is then used to encrypt the data flow between client and server.  X. 509 certificates are used to authenticate the server (and sometimes the client as well).  As a consequence, certificate authorities and public key certificates are necessary to verify the relation between the certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates.   An important property in this context is forward secrecy, which ensures that encrypted communications recorded in the past can not be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future.\n",
