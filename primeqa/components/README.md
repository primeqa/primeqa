# PrimeQA Components

We provide some simple to use interfaces that perform processing steps such as indexing, searching and answer extraction from text.
The interfaces for the retrieval, indexing and reader components are defined [here](./base.py)

## Retrieval Components

### ColBERT Engine

The following examples show how to use the _Component_ interface to index and search using the ColBERT Engine.

There is a corresponding Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/blob/main/notebooks/ir/dense/dense_ir_pipeline.ipynb).  The notebook also shows examples of data files and their formats.

#### Indexing with ColBERT Engine

- **Initializing Indexer**
```python
from primeqa.components.indexer.dense import ColBERTIndexer

indexer = ColBERTIndexer(checkpoint = checkpoint_fn, index_root = index_root, index_name = index_name, num_partitions_max = 2)
indexer.load()
```
The `checkpoint_fn` variable points to an existing model (checkpoint), more details on model training are in the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/blob/main/notebooks/ir/dense/dense_ir.ipynb). 

- **Indexing data collection**
```python
indexer.index(collection = collection_fn)
```
The `collection_fn` variable points to a data collection to be indexed. It is a _.tsv_ file, containing records in the form of _[ID, text, title]_ triples.
An example of a collection file is [here](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/blob/main/tests/resources/ir_dense/xorqa.train_ir_001pct_at_0_pct_collection_fornum.tsv).

This table shows the three lines from the file, with _text_ fields truncated:

| id | text | title |
|----|-------|-------|
| 1 | "The Kangxi Emperor's reign of 61 years ... | Kangxi Emperor |
| 2 | Yao. The Bamboo Annals says that when Emperor Zhuanxu died ... | Emperor Zhi |


#### Search with ColBERT Engine

- **Initializing Retriever**

```python
from primeqa.components.retriever.dense import ColBERTRetriever

retriever = ColBERTRetriever(index_root = index_root, index_name = index_name, max_num_documents = 1)
retriever.load()
```
The `index_root` and `index_name` varibles are the same is in the indexing step.

The `max_num_documents` variable specifies the number of documents retrieved.

- **Searching with Retriever**

```python
results = retriever.retrieve(input_texts = ['Who is Michael Wigge'])
```
The `max_num_document` variable contains document_id and scores of the retrieved documents.

## Reranker Components

The `Reranker` component takes a question and a list of documents and return a rescored and reranked list of documents.

The following is an example of question and list of documents formatted as input to the reranker:

```
    query = "what is the color of the horse?"

    documents = [{'document': {'text': 'A man is eating food.', 'title': 'A', 'docid': '0'}, 'score': 0}, 
    {'document': {'text': 'Someone in a gorilla costume is playing a set of drums.', 'title': 'in', 'docid': '1'}, 'score': 1}, 
    {'document': {'text': 'A monkey is playing drums.', 'title': 'is', 'docid': '2'}, 'score': 2}, 
    {'document': {'text': 'A man is riding a white horse on an enclosed ground.', 'title': 'riding', 'docid': '3'}, 'score': 3}, 
    {'document': {'text': 'Two men pushed carts through the woods.', 'title': 'through', 'docid': '4'}, 'score': 4}]
```

The sections below show how to run a `Reranker` on the above question/documents input.

### Sequence Classification Reranker

The [SeqClassificationReranker](./reranker/seq_classification_reranker.py) is based on the sequence-pair classification reranker as implemented in [{R}e2{G}: Retrieve, Rerank, Generate](https://github.com/IBM/kgi-slot-filling/tree/re2g). The query and passage are input together to a BERT transformer and cross attention is applied over the tokens of both sequences jointly. 


Usage:
```
    from primeqa.components.reranker.seq_classification_reranker import SeqClassificationReranker

    model_name_or_path="ibm/re2g-reranker-nq"
    reranker = SeqClassificationReranker(model=model_name_or_path)
    reranker.load()

    reranked_results = reranker.predict([query], documents=[documents],max_num_documents=2)
```

### ColBERT Reranker

The [ColBERTReranker](./reranker/colbert_reranker.py) computes representations of the input query and documents and computes the relevance scores using the ColBERT MaxSim scoring function.
The reranker requires a ColBERT checkpoint. A checkpoint can be downloaded from HuggingFace model hub as follows:
```
    wget https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA/DrDecr_XOR-TyDi_whitebox/resolve/main/DrDecr.dnn
```

Usage:
```
    from primeqa.components.reranker.seq_classification_reranker import SeqClassificationReranker

    reranker = ColBERTReranker(model=<path-to-colbert-checkpoint>)
    reranker.load()

    reranked_results = reranker.predict([query], documents=[documents],max_num_documents=2)
```
This will output:

```
    [
    [
        {
        "document": {
            "text": "A man is riding a white horse on an enclosed ground.",
            "title": "riding",
            "docid": "3"
        },
        "score": 21.647380828857422
        },
        {
        "document": {
            "text": "A monkey is playing drums.",
            "title": "is",
            "docid": "2"
        },
        "score": 11.554206848144531
        }
    ]
    ]
```


## Reader Components

### Extractive Reader

The Extractive Reader takes a question and a set of passages and returns an answer by extracting a span of text in the passages.
Follow the steps below to use the extractive reader:

- Step 1:  Initialize the reader. You can choose any of the MRC models we currently have [here](https://huggingface.co/PrimeQA).
```python
import json
from primeqa.components.reader.extractive import ExtractiveReader

reader = ExtractiveReader("PrimeQA/nq_tydi_sq1-reader-xlmr_large-20221110")
reader.load()

```
- Step 2: Execute the reader in inference mode:
```python
question = ["Which country is Canberra located in?"]
context = [["""Canberra is the capital city of Australia. 
Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia 
as the seat of government for the new nation, it is Australia's 
largest inland city"""]]
answers = reader.predict(question,context)  
print(json.dumps(answers, indent=4))  
```

### Generative Reader

A Generative Reader takes a question and uses a set of supporting passages to generate an answer. In contrast to the Extractive Reader, where the answers are usually short spans extracted from the input passages, the Generative Reader generates complex, multi-sentence answers.

#### Large Language Model Reader

We provide reader components for multiple LLMs. We currently support ChatGPT(gpt-3.5-turbo) and [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf)(text-davinci-003), using an OpenAI API key (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). We also support [FLAN T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5). 

- Step 1:  Initialize the reader.

```python
# GPT Reader
from primeqa.components.reader.prompt import PromptGPTReader
reader = PromptGPTReader(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo', api_key='API KEY HERE')
reader.load()
```

```python
# FLAN-T5 Reader
from primeqa.components.reader.prompt import PromptFLANT5Reader
reader = PromptFLANT5Reader(model_name="google/flan-t5-xxl")
reader.load()
```
- Step 2: Execute the reader in inference mode:
```python
questions = ["Does smoking marijuana impair driving ?"]
prompt_prefix = "Answer the following question."
answers = reader.predict(questions,prefix=prompt_prefix)
print(json.dumps(answers, indent=4))
```

A notebook with additional examples is available [here](/notebooks/mrc/LLM_reader_predict_mode.ipynb)


#### FiD Reader

PrimeQA implements a [Fusion In Decoder(FiD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01282) generative reader. 

Follow the steps below to use the `GenerativeFiDReader`:

- Step 1:  Initialize the reader.
```python
import json
from primeqa.components.reader.generative import GenerativeFiDReader
fid_reader = GenerativeFiDReader()
fid_reader.load()
```

- Step 2: Execute the reader in inference mode:
```python
question = ["What causes the trail behind jets at high altitude?"]
context = [["""Chemtrail conspiracy theory The chemtrail conspiracy theory is based 
            on the erroneous belief that long-lasting condensation trails are 
            \"chemtrails\" consisting of chemical or biological agents left in the 
            sky by high-flying aircraft, sprayed for nefarious purposes undisclosed 
            to the general public. Believers in this conspiracy theory say that while 
            normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly, contrails that linger must 
            contain additional substances. Those who subscribe to the theory speculate 
            that the purpose of the chemical release may be solar radiation management,
            weather modification, psychological manipulation, human population control, 
            or biological or chemical warfare, and that the trails are causing

            The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei 
            when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. 
            One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can 
            form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated

answers = fid_reader.predict(question,context)  
print(json.dumps(answers, indent=4))
