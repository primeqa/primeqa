# PrimeQA Extensions

Under extensions, we have all the scripts necessary to perform experiments to train (fine-tune) and validate the models from academic benchmarks / papers. The general recommendation is to "use" PrimeQA components and not re-write tools that we already have under the main [PrimeQA entry-points](https://github.com/primeqa/primeqa/tree/main/primeqa/components) e.g. Reader components, Retriever components, Generator components.

Take a look at the individual directories that contains the code for the algorithms that use various PrimeQA components for doing experiments.
