1. tableqg_inference.ipynb: Shows how to use our pre-trained tableQG model uploaded and available in Hugggingface to generate a question on a given table. 
2. tableqg_training.ipynb: Shows how to train the TableQG model with WikiSQL data (available in HuggingFace). 
3. passageqg_inference.ipynb: Shows how to use our pre-trained multi-lingual passageQG model uploaded and available in Hugggingface to generate a question on a given passage and optionally answer(s).
4. passageqg_training.ipynb: Shows how to train the PassageQG model with TydiQA data (available in HuggingFace).
