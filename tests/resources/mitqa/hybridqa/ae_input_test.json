Death is 19 November 1505 . Son ( s ) is Selim I . Selim I ( Ottoman Turkish : \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0644 , Turkish : Birinci Selim ; 10 October 1470 - 22 September 1520 ) , known as Selim the Grim or Selim the Resolute ( Turkish : Yavuz Sultan Selim ) , was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1512 to 1520 . His reign is notable for the enormous expansion of the Empire , particularly his conquest between 1516 and 1517 of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt , which included all of the Levant , Hejaz , Tihamah , and Egypt itself . On the eve of his death in 1520 , the Ottoman Empire spanned about 576,900 sq mi ( 1,494,000 km2 ) , having grown by seventy percent during Selim 's reign . Selim 's conquest of the Middle Eastern heartlands of the Muslim world , and particularly his assumption of the role of guardian of the pilgrimage routes to Mecca and Medina , established the Ottoman Empire as the most prestigious of all Sunni Muslim states . His conquests dramatically shifted the empire 's geographical and cultural center of gravity away from the Balkans and toward the Middle East . By the eighteenth century , Selim 's conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate had come to be romanticized as the moment when the Ottomans seized leadership over the rest of the Muslim world , and consequently Selim is popularly remembered as the first legitimate Ottoman Caliph , although stories of an official transfer of the caliphal office from the Abbasid Dynasty of Cairo to the Ottomans were a later invention . G\u00fclbahar is a Turkish given name for females and may refer to : The Anatolian beylik of Dulkadir ( Modern Turkish : Dulkadiro\u011fullar\u0131 Beyli\u011fi ) , was one of the frontier principalities established by the Oghuz , Turcoman clans Bayat , Afshar and Begdili after the decline of Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm . Elbistan is a district in Kahramanmara\u015f Province in southern Turkey . Its population is 95,037 , [ citation needed ] and it is the most populous district of Kahramanmara\u015f province . It is also the largest district of the province by area and it has the fourth largest plain in the country . The climate is very dry , but irrigation is provided by the Ceyhan river , one of the biggest rivers in Turkey . The city used to be the capital city of the Dulkadirids after capturing from Eretnids in 1337 . In 1277 the Mamluks led by Sultan Baibars defeated a Mongol army in the Battle of Elbistan . The region was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire shortly before the campaign against the Mameluks of Egypt in 1512 , although some local chiefdoms were given varying degrees of autonomy , notably around the localities of Haticep\u0131nar and Kasanl\u0131 . The Oghuz , Oguz or Ghuzz Turks ( Middle Turkic : \u0671\u063a\u064f\u0632 O\u03b3uz , Old Turkic : \ud803\udc06\ud803\udc0d\ud803\udc14 , romanized : O\u03b3uz ) were western Turkic people who spoke the Oghuz languages from the Common branch of the Turkic language family . In the 8th century , they formed a tribal confederation conventionally named the Oghuz Yabgu State in central Asia . The name Oghuz is a Common Turkic word for tribe . Byzantine sources call the Oghuz the Uzes ( \u039f\u1f50\u0311\u03b6\u03bf\u03b9 , Ouzoi ) . By the 10th century , Islamic sources were calling them Muslim Turkmens , as opposed to shamanist or Buddhist . By the 12th century this term had passed into Byzantine usage and the Oghuzes were overwhelmingly Muslim . The term 'Oghuz ' was gradually supplanted among the Turks themselves by Turkmen and Turcoman , ( Ottoman Turkish : \u062a\u0631\u0643\u0645\u0646\u0644\u0631 , romanized : T\u00fcrkmen or T\u00fcrkm\u00e2n ) from the mid 900 's on , a process which was completed by the beginning of the 1200s . Mahmud al-Kashgari says that Turkmen has a broader meaning by saying that Karluks are also Turkmens but differ from Oghuz . The Oghuz confederation migrated westward from the Jeti-su area after a conflict with the Karluk allies of the Uyghurs . Today , a percentage of the residents of Turkey , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are descendants of Oghuz Turks and their language belongs to the Oghuz group of the Turkic languages family . In the 9th century , the Oghuzes from the Aral steppes drove Bechens from the Emba and Ural River region toward the west . In the 10th century , they inhabited the steppe of the rivers Sari-su , Turgai , and Emba to the north of Lake Balkhash of modern-day Kazakhstan .",
