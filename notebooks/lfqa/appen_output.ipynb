Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk cost, and learning curve theory.  Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost.  There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive.  Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy.  Several tool and techniques can help you develop cost estimates, including analogous estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric estimating, and computerized tools.  Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time.   Controlling cost includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to cost.  Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance.  Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information.   Several software products can assists with project cost management.  Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.\n",
